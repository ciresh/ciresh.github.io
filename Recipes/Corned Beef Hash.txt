Corned Beef Hash

3 tablespoons Unsalted Butter
1 small onion, chopped fine
Salt and pepper
2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces
2 garlic cloves, minced
¾ cup water
12 ounces cooked corned beef, shredded into bite-size pieces
1 tablespoon Hot Sauce, plus extra for serving

1. Melt butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; add potatoes, garlic, and water. Cover and cook for 6 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until potatoes are cooked through and no water remains in skillet, about 6 minutes longer.

2. Remove skillet from heat and, using spatula or wooden spoon, mash approximately one-eighth of potatoes. Stir mashed potatoes into potato pieces until lightly coated. Stir in corned beef and hot sauce and toss until well combined. Press hash into even layer. Return skillet to high heat and cook, without stirring, for 3 minutes. Carefully slide hash onto large plate. Invert hash onto second plate and, using spatula, slide hash back into skillet. Return hash to high heat and cook second side until browned and crisp around edges, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to platter and serve, passing extra hot sauce.
