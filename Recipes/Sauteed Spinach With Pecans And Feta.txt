Sauteed Spinach With Pecans And Feta

INGREDIENTS
3 (6-ounce) bags baby spinach (about 16 cups)
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons for drizzling
3 large shallots, sliced thin crosswise (about 1 cup)
Table salt
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1/3 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1 1/2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 1/4 cup)

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place spinach and water in large microwave-safe bowl. Cover bowl with large microwave-safe dinner plate (plate should completely cover bowl and not rest on spinach). Microwave on high power until spinach is wilted and decreased in volume by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Using potholders, remove bowl from microwave and keep covered for 1 minute. Carefully remove plate and transfer spinach to colander set in sink. Using back of rubber spatula, gently press spinach against colander to release excess liquid. Transfer spinach to cutting board and roughly chop. Return to colander and press a second time.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil and shallots in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until shallots are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add spinach to skillet, using tongs to stir and coat with oil. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and continue stirring with tongs until spinach is uniformly wilted and glossy green, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with vinegar and pecans; stir to combine. Drizzle with remaining 2 teaspoons oil and sprinkle with feta. Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.
