Instant Pot Chick Peas

1 cup dry Chickpeas/Garbanzo Beans
4 cup Water
3-4 cloves Garlic
2 bay leaves
1/2 tsp chicken bouillon

Rinse the chickpeas, and add them to the Instant Pot.

Add the water, garlic, bay leaves and chicken bouillon
Place the top on the Instant Pot - close the valve, and set the Instant Pot to beans for 35 minutes. Plan on it taking about 10-15 minutes for the pot to come up to pressure and start cooking.

Once the applicance has beeped that cooking is completed, allow for the pressure to release naturally which will take another 15 minutes.

Drain beans and save the broth if making hummus.
