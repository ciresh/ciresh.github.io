Doug's Smoked Mushroom Dip

8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms, smoked*
12 oz. Whipped Philly Cream Cheese
8 oz. Sour Cream
1/8 t. garlic powder
1 t. onion flakes, ground
1 t. kosher salt
2-3 T. pine nuts, finely chopped
fresh ground black pepper
2 small chunks hickory wood

*Butter a small 10x14" baking pan, and spread mushroom slices out in a single layer. Add fresh ground pepper to suit. Place in 235-250° smoker, add smokewood, and smoke for 75-90 minutes. The slices should be cooked, but still slightly firm. Remove and allow to cool. (During a rib cook, I set the pan on top of some foiled ribs, and just threw the wood on top of the coals.)

In a 6 cup bowl, fold together cream cheese and sour cream. Add garlic powder, onion, salt, and pine nuts, and mix in thoroughly. Chop smoked mushroom slices coarsely (1/4" - 1/2" pieces), and fold into base mixture. Refrigerate and allow flavors to combine for at least a few hours.

For a thicker, chunkier dip, reduce sour cream to either 4 or 6 ounces, starting with 4 and adding as desired.
