Seafood Lasagna

You can always splurge on fresh crabmeat, but we tested this dish with canned Chicken of the Sea lump crabmeat and liked the results. Shrimp shells render a quick stock to flavor the sauce. We used oven-ready lasagna noodles to save time.


2 teaspoons olive oil
5 cups finely chopped mushrooms (about 1 pound)
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 (6.5-ounce) cans lump crabmeat
1 pound uncooked large shrimp
2 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons celery salt
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 1/4 cups (5 ounces) crumbled goat or feta cheese
1 cup 2% reduced-fat cottage cheese
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup 1% low-fat milk
1/4 cup (1 ounce) grated fresh Parmesan cheese
Cooking spray
1 (8-ounce) package precooked lasagna noodles
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Preheat oven to 375°.

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, thyme, and 2 garlic cloves; cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add wine. Bring to a boil; cook 1 1/2 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates. Remove from heat; stir in crabmeat. Set aside.

Peel and devein shrimp, reserving shells. Cut each shrimp in half lengthwise; cover and refrigerate. Combine reserved shrimp shells, 2 cups water, celery salt, and fennel seeds in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups shrimp stock (about 15 minutes). Strain stock through a sieve into a bowl; discard solids. Set stock aside.

Combine goat cheese, cottage cheese, basil, juice, and 1 garlic clove; set aside.

Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup, and level with a knife. Place flour in a small saucepan; gradually add milk, stirring with a whisk. Stir in shrimp stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer 5 minutes or until thick. Remove from heat; stir in Parmesan cheese.

Spread 1/2 cup sauce in bottom of a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Arrange 4 noodles, slightly overlapping, over sauce; top with one-third goat cheese mixture, one-third crab mixture, one-third shrimp, 2/3 cup sauce, and 2/3 cup mozzarella. Repeat layers twice, ending with mozzarella. Bake at 375° for 40 minutes or until golden. Let stand 15 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.
