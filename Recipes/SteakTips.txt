MARINATED BEEF TIPS	 
source:http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,1627,153172-235200,00.html

1/4 c. olive oil
1/4 c. maple syrup
1/4 c. red wine vinegar
1/4 c. soy sauce
Parsley
4 chopped garlic cloves
Oregano
Pepper
4 lbs. sirloin steak tips
2 lbs. sm. white onions
2 red peppers
2 green peppers
1 lg. pkg. mushrooms

Marinate steak tips in the first 8 ingredients for at least 6 hours. (Can be done 24 hours ahead). Add veggies 1 hour before grilling (can be added as you grill, but it is not as tasty). Put foil on grill and steak and vegetables together on top of that. HINT: Great for marinating London Broil, too.

EJS: I like to skip the red wine vinegar and double the maple
