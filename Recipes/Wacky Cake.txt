Wacky Cake

Serves 6 to 8

This moist cake gets even better when served with vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.
1 1/2 	cups all-purpose flour 
3/4 	cup sugar 
1/4 	cup natural cocoa powder 
3/4 	teaspoon baking soda 
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
5 	tablespoons vegetable oil 
1 	tablespoon distilled white vinegar 
1 	teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 	cup water 
	Confectioners' sugar 

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Coat 8-inch-square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.

2. Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in pan. As shown in photo 1, make 1 large and 2 small craters in dry ingredients. Add oil to large crater and vinegar and vanilla separately to remaining small craters. Pour water into pan (photo 2), and mix until just a few streaks of flour remain (photo 3). Immediately put pan in oven.

3. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan, then dust with confectioners’ sugar. (If tightly wrapped, cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.)
