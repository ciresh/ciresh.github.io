Sour Cream Cornbread

This recipe comes from the book CookWise by Shirley O. Corriher. Shirley says there are many variations on this Southern recipe, which uses sour cream, creamed corn and quite a bit of oil to make a very moist cornbread.
Ingredients List
3 large eggs, beaten
1-1/2 cups canned creamed corn
1-1/2 cups (14 oz) sour cream
3/4 cup corn oil
1-1/2 cups yellow self-rising corn meal mix, slightly packed
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
Nonstick cooking spray
3 Tablespoons melted butter
You can substitute canola or vegetable oil, but I think it makes sense to use corn oil when making cornbread if you can.

Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs slightly. Stir in the sour cream, creamed corn, and oil, then add the corn meal mix, salt, and baking powder. Stir well to combine the ingredients.

Spray a 10" cast iron skillet with nonstick cooking spray and pour in the batter. Heat the skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat for 1 minute, then place into the upper third of the oven. Immediately reduce the oven to 375°F and bake 35-40 minutes.

To finish, turn on the broiler and brown the top of the cornbread for about 1 minute. Don't walk away during the browning process, as the cornbread can burn quickly. Brush the top with the melted butter and enjoy!
