Broccoli Cheese Soup

Serves 6 to 8

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 pounds broccoli, florets cut into 1-inch pieces, stalks peeled and sliced 1 inch thick
1 onion, chopped coarse
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoons dry mustard powder
Pinch cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper
3â€“4 cups water
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 ounces (2 cups) baby spinach
3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (3/4 cup)
1 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated fine (3/4 cup), plus extra for
serving

1. Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion,
garlic, dry mustard, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring
frequently, until fragrant, about 6 minutes. Add 1 cup water and baking
soda. Bring to simmer, cover, and cook until broccoli is very soft, about 20
minutes, stirring once during cooking.

2. Add broth and 2 cups water and increase heat to medium-high. When
mixture begins to simmer, stir in spinach and cook until wilted, about 1
minute. Transfer half of soup to blender, add cheddar and Parmesan, and
process until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer soup to medium bowl and
repeat with remaining soup. Return soup to pot, place over medium heat and
bring to simmer. Adjust consistency of soup with up to 1 cup remaining
water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, passing extra Parmesan
separately.
