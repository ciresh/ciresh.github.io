Sauteed Corn With Bacon And Leeks

INGREDIENTS

6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 pound leeks, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, sliced thin, and washed thoroughly
Salt
4 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (4 cups)
1/4 cup minced fresh chives
1-2 tablespoons cider vinegar
Pinch cayenne pepper
INSTRUCTIONS
1. Cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate. Pour off and reserve all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet.

2. Add leeks and 1/4 teaspoon salt to fat in skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer leeks to large bowl and wipe out skillet.

3. Heat 1 tablespoon reserved fat in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add corn and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, without stirring, until corn is browned on bottom and beginning to pop, about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring once or twice, until corn is spotty brown all over, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer corn to bowl with leeks.

4. Stir in chives, 1 tablespoon vinegar, cayenne, and bacon. Season with salt and remaining vinegar to taste. Serve.
