Master Recipe for Ice Cream

Makes about 1 quart

4-inch piece of vanilla bean or 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup whole milk
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2 cups heavy cream
1 large egg plus 2 egg yolks

Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, scrapping both side with a paring knife, Reserve both the pod and the scrapings., Combine milk,m 2/3 cup of the sugar, the heavy cream, and the reserved vanilla pod and scrapings in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. (If using vanilla extract, do not add it now,) Bring mixture to 175 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, combine the whole egg and egg yolks with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a medium bowl and beat with an electric mixer or whisk by hand until pale yellow and thick, about 2 minutes with a mixer or 4 minutes by hand.

Remove 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture from the saucepan and add slowly to the beaten egg yolks while whisking vigorously. Whisk this mixture back in the saucepan. Over low heat, cook mixture until it reaches 180 degrees, stirring constantly (about 5 minutes). The custard should be the thickness f heavy cream bu should not biol or bubble. If the mixture starts to give off a fair amount of steam, take it off the heat for a few moments and stir vigorously. This is a sign that that custard is about the boil.

Pour custard through a fine mesh strainer into a non-reactive bowl. Remove vanilla pod (if using) from the strainer and add to mixture. If using vanilla extract, stir it into the custard now. Place bowl into a large bowl filled halfway with ice water to cool. When mixture reaches room temperature, cover bowl with plastic  wrap and refrigerate. It is best to refrigerate the custard overnight or for at least 6 hours.

Put into ice cream maker then put in freezer for 1-2 hours.
