Pocketless Pita

3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup lukewarm water
2 tablespoons butter , melted
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 teaspoon salt
3.5 to 4 cups flour

Combine milk, water, butter, and honey in mixing bowl of a standing mixer with dough hook

Add yeast and mix for a few second to combine

Add salt followed by enough flour to form a soft dough

Knead dough for 3 to 4 minutes

Place dough in oiled bowl, cover and let rest for 1 hour

After 1 hour, form dough into 8 smaller balls and heat up a non-stick pancake griddle

On a floured flat surface, roll out each dough ball into a flat circle about 6 to 7 each in diameter sprinkling with more flour if needed to prevent sticking.

Grill each pita for a few minutes until they begin bubbling and are very lightly golden brown, then flip and cook the reverse side
