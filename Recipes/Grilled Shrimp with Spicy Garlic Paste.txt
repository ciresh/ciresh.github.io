Cooks Illustrated

To keep the shrimp from dropping through the grill rack onto the hot coals, thread them onto skewers or use a perforated grill pan.

2 	cups kosher salt 
2 	pounds large shrimp (31-40), frozen
1 	large clove garlic 
1 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2	teaspoon cayenne pepper 
1 	teaspoon paprika 
2 	tablespoons olive oil 
2 	teaspoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
	lemon wedges 
	


1. Pour 2 cups boiling water in large bowl; add salt and stir until almost dissolved. Add 3 1/2 quarts cold water (along with some ice if ambient temperature is over 70 degrees); stir until salt completely dissolves. Add shrimp and let stand about 45 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Refrigerate until ready to cook.

2. Mince garlic with salt; mix it with cayenne and paprika in small bowl. Add olive oil and lemon juice to form thin paste. Toss shrimp with paste until evely coated. (Can be covered and refrigerated up to 1 hour). Thread shrimp onto skewer, if desired.

3. Heat grill or broiler. Grill or broil shrimp turning once, until shells turn bright pink, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges.
