Best-Ever Hot Cocoa Mix
This hot cocoa mix can be stored in an airtight container for three months. It uses two unusual ingredients: White chocolate chips give the cocoa a soft, creamy texture and escalate the chocolate flavor; and the cornstarch in the confectioners' sugar (an ingredient manufacturers add to prevent clumping) helps thicken the cocoa.

Makes about 20 servings

    * 3 cups nonfat dry milk
    * 2 cups confectioners' sugar
    * 1 1/2 cups Dutch-processed cocoa powder
    * 1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt

Combine ingredients in large bowl. Working in two batches, pulse ingredients in food processor until chocolate is finely ground. To make hot cocoa, stir 1/3 cup mix into 1 cup hot milk. Top with whipped cream or mini marshmallows.
