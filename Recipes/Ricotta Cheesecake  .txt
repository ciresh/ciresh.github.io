ingredients 

Unsalted butter, softened for pan
Plain dried breadcrumbs, for pan
1 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
Finely grated zest of 1 orange
2 containers (15 ounces each) ricotta cheese, preferably whole-milk (3 1/3 cups)
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Preheat oven to 350°. Butter a 9-inch springform pan, and dust with breadcrumbs, tapping out excess. In a small bowl, stir together raisins, flour, and zests; set aside. 
With an electric mixer, beat ricotta, sugar, and salt until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. With mixer on low speed, add flour mixture, and beat just until smooth (don't overmix). 
Pour mixture into prepared pan; place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until cake is browned and jiggles only slightly when shaken, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool completely in pan; unmold to serve. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
