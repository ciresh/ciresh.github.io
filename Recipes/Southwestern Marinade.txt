Southwestern Marinade
Makes enough for 2 pounds of steak tips

1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

2 pounds flap meat sirloin steak tips, trimmed of excess fat
Orange wedges for serving

To create the marinade, combine all ingredients except the flap meat and orange wedges in a small bowl.

Combine the marinade and meat in a gallon-size zipper-lock bag; press out as much air as possible and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 1 hour, flipping the bag after 30 minutes to ensure that the meat marinates evenly.
