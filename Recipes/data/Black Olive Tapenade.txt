Black Olive Tapenade

INGREDIENTS

1/3 cup pine nuts
1 1/2 cups pitted kalamata olives
1/2 cup pitted salt-cured black olives
3 tablespoons capers, rinsed
2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and patted dry
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 garlic clove, minced
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
INSTRUCTIONS
1. In food processor fitted with metal blade, process pine nuts until reduced to paste that clings to walls and avoids blade, about 20 seconds. Scrape down bowl to redistribute paste and process until paste again clings to walls and avoids blade, about 5 seconds. Repeat scraping and processing once more (pine nuts should form mostly smooth, tahini-like paste).

2. Scrape down bowl to redistribute paste and add olives, capers, anchovies, mustard, and garlic. Pulse until finely chopped, about 15 pulses, scraping down bowl halfway through pulsing. Transfer mixture to medium bowl and stir in oil until well combined.

3. Transfer to container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 18 hours or up to 2 weeks. Bring to room temperature and stir thoroughly before serving.
