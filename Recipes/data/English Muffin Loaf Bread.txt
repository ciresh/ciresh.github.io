English Muffin Loaf Bread
From the Cook's Country show on PBS, aired on October 19, 2013 (recipe is published in The Best of America's Test Kitchen, 2013 but I noticed it called for 2 1/2 cups of milk instead of 3; use 3 cups because it works!)

- For two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 loaves (you can divide the recipe in half to make one loaf) - 

5 cups unbleached bread flour* 
4 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 cups whole milk, heated to 120 degrees
Cornmeal, for pans

* For a whole wheat version, I substitute half the bread flour with white whole wheat flour.  

Place flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and baking soda into a large mixing bowl. Whisk well to combine. Make a slight well in the center and add the warm milk into it.  Stir with a wooden spoon until combined and dough starts pulling away from the sides of the bowl.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap that's been lightly sprayed with vegetable oil.  Let sit in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.  

Spray two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pans with cooking spray and dust with cornmeal. Give dough a stir with a rubber spatula to knock it down a bit.  Divide the dough as evenly as possible between the two loaf pans.  The batter will be sticky and should fill the pans about 2/3 of the way.  Use a rubber spatula to gently coax the batter into the corners.  Cover the pans with greased plastic wrap.  Let sit to rise for 30 minutes. The dough should rise near to the top of the pan.

Bake in a 375 degree oven, in the middle rack for 30 minutes, rotating halfway through.  The internal temperature of the finished loaf should be 200 degrees when done.
