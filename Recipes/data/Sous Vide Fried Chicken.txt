Sous Vide Fried Chicken (Can't-F*ck-It-Up Fried Chicken)

Ingredients
1 whole chicken
2 1/2 tablespoons salt
Frying oil (we like canola), as needed
Black pepper, freshly ground, as needed
1 lb, 10 1/2 ounces pastry flour (or all-purpose)
1 ounce paprika (optional)
3/4 ounce onion powder (optional)
1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
1 lb, 1 1/2 ounces buttermilk

Heat water to 155 degrees F.

Divide the chicken into pieces. You’ll want to end up with skin-on thighs, drumsticks and two whole, boneless breasts.
Season the pieces all over with salt. A good starting point is about 1 percent salt to the weight of the pieces.

Place the pieces into sous vide bags, dark meat with dark meat and breasts with breasts. Transfer breasts to the fridge to chill (the dark meat is going to be cooked longer).

Cook dark meat in water for at least two hours. Add breasts and cook all pieces for an additional hour.

Heat at least 3 inches of frying oil in a Dutch oven or stockpot over high heat until the oil reaches about 400 degrees F.
To make the breading:

Remove cooked chicken pieces from the water and pat dry. Cut breasts in half, lengthwise. Place chicken pieces on a metal rack.
Mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl and set aside. Add buttermilk to a second bowl.

Prefer your chicken crunchy or crispy? If you fall in the first camp, dredge pieces in flour, then buttermilk, then flour again. For crispier chicken, just dunk the pieces in the buttermilk, move them to the bowl with the dry ingredients, then fry. If you’re not sure which you prefer, try both!

Working in batches, fry the chicken pieces in the oil until they’ve got a gorgeous golden crust, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer the finished pieces to the wire rack in the oven to keep warm.
