Instant Pot Risotto a la Carbonara 

3 1/2 c. chicken stock
8 oz. diced pancetta
1/2 small onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 c. uncooked Arborio rice
1/2 c. white wine
1/2 c. shredded Parmesan cheese, plus more for sprinkling
2 tbsp. salted butter
4 large egg yolks
Salt
Minced fresh parsley, for garnish

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the chicken stock to a simmer.

Set an Instant Pot to saut√© and add the diced pancetta. Cook the pancetta, stirring occasionally, until the fat has rendered and it begins to crisp, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate.

Add the onion and garlic to the rendered fat and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the rice to the pot and stir until well combined, toasting the rice for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the wine to the pot to deglaze it, scraping up any brown bits in the bottom of the pot. Add the heated chicken stock and stir until well combined. Cook at high pressure for 5 minutes. Once done, quick release the pressure.

Remove the cover and stir in the Parmesan, butter and pancetta until smooth and creamy. Quickly stir in the egg yolks, one at a time, and season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, sprinkled with Parmesan and garnished with minced fresh parsley.
