Salad with Apple, Celery, Hazelnuts, and Roquefort

11/2004

We tried a half-dozen varieties of blue cheese and all were acceptable, but tasters favored rich, creamy Roquefort. If you prefer to use a very mild and mellow blue cheese, we recommend Danish blue; if you prefer a sharp and piquant one, try Stilton. Use a dishtowel to rub the skins from the hazelnuts while still hot. Blanched slivered almonds can be substituted for hazelnuts.

Serves 6 as a first course
1 tablespoon honey 
3 tablespoons cider vinegar 
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
1/4 teaspoon table salt 
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1 apple (sweet red such as Braeburn or Fuji), cored and sliced very thin (about 2 cups)
2 ribs celery , sliced very thin on bias (about 1 1/4 cups)
1 medium head red leaf lettuce (or green), washed, dried, and torn into bite-size pieces (9 cups)
1/4 cup loosely packed torn fresh parsley leaves 
1/2 cup hazelnuts , toasted in medium skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes, then skinned and chopped fine
6 ounces Roquefort cheese , crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups)


1. Whisk honey, vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper in small bowl until combined. In medium bowl, toss apple and celery with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette; let stand 5 minutes.

2. Toss lettuce, parsley, and remaining vinaigrette in large bowl; adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Divide greens among individual plates; top each with portion of apple/celery mixture, nuts, and Roquefort. Serve immediately.
