Sweet and Sour Chicken

1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
1 teaspoon ground ginger 
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
Kosher salt and ground black pepper 
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks 
3 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil 
1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced 
16-ounce bag frozen mixed bell pepper strips 
2 cups shredded carrots 
20-ounce can pineapple chunks in unsweetened juice 
1/2 cup packed brown sugar 
1/2 cup red wine vinegar 
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
Cooked rice, for serving 

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, ginger, garlic powder. and 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. 
Add the chicken, then toss until lightly but completely coated. It should use all of the flour mixture. 
In a large sauté pan over medium-high, heat the oil until it shimmers. Cover a wire rack with paper towels. 

Working in two batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the chicken and fry for 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the rack and repeat with remaining chicken. 

When all of the chicken is browned, increase the heat to high and add the onion, peppers, and carrots. Sauté for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the juice from the pineapple, the brown sugar, vinegar, and cornstarch. Add to the pan and stir until thick, about 1 minute. Add the chicken and pineapple chunks. Simmer for 2 minutes. Serve the chicken and sauce over rice.
