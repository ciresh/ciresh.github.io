Partial thawing of the spinach produces a cold dip that can be served without further chilling. If you don?t own a microwave, the frozen spinach can be thawed at room temperature for 11/2 hours then squeezed of excess liquid. The garlic must be minced or pressed before going into the food processor; otherwise the dip will contain large chunks of garlic. This dip is good served with tortilla chips.

Makes about 1 1/2 cups
10 	ounces frozen chopped spinach 
1/2 	cup sour cream 
1/2 	cup mayonnaise 
2 	tablespoons thin-sliced scallions white parts only, from 3 medium scallions
1 	tablespoon fresh dill , chopped
1/2 	cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaf 
1 	small clove garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1/4 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
1/4 	cup fresh cilantro leaves  , packed
1 	tablespoon chipotle chile en adobo , seeded and minced (about 2 medium chiles)
1 	tablespoon lime juice 
1/2 	teaspoon grated lime zest 
1/2 	teaspoon light brown sugar 
1/8 	teaspoon ground cumin 
	


1. Thaw spinach in microwave for 3 minutes at 40 percent power. (Edges should be thawed but not warm; center should be soft enough to be broken apart into icy chunks.) Squeeze partially frozen spinach of excess water.

2. In food processor, process spinach, sour cream, mayonnaise, scallions, dill, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, cilantro, chipotle chiles, lime juice, lime zest, light brown sugar, and cumin until smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to medium bowl; serve. (Dip can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 2 days.)
