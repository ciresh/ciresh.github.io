Leaner Fresh Peach Ice Cream

4 medium-size ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice from 1 lemon
pinch table salt
1 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1/4 cups heavy cream
4 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons vodka

1. Stir peaches, lemon juice, a pinch salt, and 1/3 cup sugar in medium-size nonreactive saucepan to combine; let stand until a pool of syrupy liquid accumulates and peaches soften slightly, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

2. Position sieve over medium bowl set in an ice-water bath; set aside. Heat milk, cream, and 1/3 cup sugar in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until steam appears, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn off heat. Meanwhile, whisk yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in medium bowl until pale yellow. Stir half the warmed milk mixture into beaten yolk mixture until just blended. Return milk-yolk mixture to saucepan of remaining warmed milk mixture. Heat milk-yolk mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with wooden spoon until steam appears, foam subsides, and mixture just begins to thicken (see illustrations below) or instant-read thermometer registers 180 degrees (mixture must not boil or eggs will curdle). Remove from heat, and following step 3 in illustration, immediately strain custard into prepared bowl. Cool custard mixture to room temperature, stir in vanilla, then cover and refrigerate until instant-read thermometer registers 40 degrees, at least 2 and up to 24 hours.

3. Meanwhile, heat softened peaches and their liquid, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until peaches are tender and flesh has broken down, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to bowl, stir in vodka, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 and up to 24 hours.

4. Strain chilled peaches, reserving liquid. Stir reserved peach liquid into chilled custard mixture; churn, until mixture is frozen, 25 to 30 minutes. Add peaches; churn about 30 seconds longer.
