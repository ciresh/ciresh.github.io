Banana Bread Mug Cake in a Minute

1 medium very ripe banana
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoons melted unsalted butter
1 tablespoon milk
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 tablespoons dark chocolate chips
6 slices banana
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste

Combine ripe banana, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, melted butter, milk, and vanilla in a mixing bowl; use a potato masher to mash the mixture into a smooth puree. Add flour and mix until just combined. Stir in walnuts and chocolate chips until evenly mixed.

Transfer batter evenly into two lightly buttered coffee mugs or cups. Tap a few times on a towel to settle everything down and ensure there are no air pockets.

Microwave cups, one at a time, until a toothpick comes out clean, about 1 minute.

Let cool before serving.

Optional: Garnish each with banana slices and dust with sugar. Brulee the tops with a blowtorch.

Chef's Notes: The walnuts and chocolate chips are optional. You can add a splash of rum to this cake if you like. You might have to experiment with cook times depending on your personal microwave.
