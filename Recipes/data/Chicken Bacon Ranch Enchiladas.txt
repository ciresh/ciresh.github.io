Chicken Bacon Ranch Enchilada

Enchilada Sauce

1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons New Mexico or California chili powder
2 tablespoons self-rising flour
2 tablespoons Brown Sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 1/2 cups water (or Broth)
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion salt

Salt to taste

Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in chili powder and flour, reduce heat to medium, and cook until fragrant and deepened in color, stirring constantly to prevent the flour from burning, about 1 minute.

Gradually stir in water, tomato sauce, cumin, garlic powder, and onion salt until smooth. Continue cooking over medium heat until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.
