Roasted Cauliflower – Miznon Style

1 small head of cauliflower
Sea salt
Maldon sea salt flakes, or other coarse brand
Olive oil

Preheat oven to 500.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 3 Tablespoons of sea salt, stir to dissolve.

Wash the cauliflower and cut the base so it stands upright, keeping the leaves intact.

Place the head of cauliflower in the boiling water.

Place the lid of a pot or a ceramic plate on top of the cauliflower to keep it submerged.

Boil for 7-9 minutes or until a knife inserted in the cauliflower meets some resistance at the middle.

Place the hot cauliflower on a sheet pan and allow to cool until you no longer see steam coming off of it. This should take about 15-20 minutes.

Rub the cauliflower with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt.

Roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until browned.

Remove from the oven and drizzle with olive oil and Maldon sea salt flakes.

Serve alone or with your favorite vinegar.
