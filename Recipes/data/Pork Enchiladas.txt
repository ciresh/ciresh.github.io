Pork Enchiladas
from Everyday Food

1 pound pork loin, quartered lengthwise and halved crosswise
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Coarse salt
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cups mild green salsa
8 corn tortillas (6-inch)
3/4 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese (3 ounces)
1 plum tomato, diced, for garnish (optional)

Dust pork with cumin and oregano; season with salt. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat; swirl to coat bottom of pan. Add pork; cook until browned on all sides and slightly pink in the middle, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes before slicing thinly. Set skillet aside.

Preheat oven to 450°. In a blender, purée salsa with 1/4 cup water until smooth. Add to skillet; cook over medium heat until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes.

Warm tortillas according to package instructions. Place on work surface. Evenly divide sliced pork and 1/4 cheese among the tortillas. Roll each tortilla into a cylinder; place seam side down in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Top with heated salsa mixture and remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake until cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve immediately, garnished with tomato, if desired.
