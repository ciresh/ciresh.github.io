Seared Scallops with Cilantro Pesto

Pesto  
1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 medium clove garlic, chopped coarse
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest from 1 small lemon
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil

Scallops  

1 1/2 pounds sea scallops, about 30 to a pound, small side muscles removed (see illustration below)
Salt and ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil


1. Pulse cilantro, pine nuts, garlic, zest, salt, and pepper in bowl of food processor until minced. With motor running, gradually add oil. Process until smooth; set aside.

2. Sprinkle scallops on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat large (11-inch) saut√© pan over medium-high heat until hot, about 1 minute. Add half the oil; swirl to coat bottom. Continue to heat pan until butter begins to turn golden brown. Add half the scallops, one at a time, flat side down; cook, adjusting heat as necessary to prevent fat from burning, until scallops are well browned, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Using tongs, turn scallops, one at a time; cook until medium-rare (sides firmed up and all but middle third of scallop opaque), 30 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes longer, depending on size. Repeat cooking process using remaining half of oil and scallops. Divide scallops among four plates. Drizzle portion of pesto over each plate of scallops. Serve immediately.
