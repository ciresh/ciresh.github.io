Arugula and Radicchio Salad with Warm Goat Cheese and Olive Dressing

11/1998

Goat cheese can be difficult to slice neatly. If you have trouble, try wiping the knife blade with a cold, damp kitchen towel before each slice.

Serves 6
3 tablespoons fine, unflavored dried bread crumbs 
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves  
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary 
1 small log goat cheese (4 ounces), cut into 6 equal rounds
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
1 medium clove garlic , minced
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
1/2 cup oil-cured black olives , pitted and chopped fine
1/4 teaspoon table salt 
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 
4 large bunches arugula , washed, dried, stems trimmed and leaves torn into bite-sized pieces (about 6 1/2 cups, loosely packed)
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
1 medium head radicchio , washed, dried, and leaves torn into bite-sized pieces (about 2 1/2 cups, loosely packed)


1. Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Stir bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon each of the thyme and rosemary to combine in a shallow pie pan. Brush goat cheese rounds lightly with 1 tablespoon olive oil and gently press both sides and edges in bread crumb mixture to coat thoroughly with bread crumb mixture (can be done up to 1 hour before serving time and refrigerated on baking sheet until ready to bake).

2. Whisk garlic, vinegar, olives, remaining thyme and rosemary, salt, and pepper in small bowl; gradually whisk in remaining 1/3 cup olive oil; set aside.

3. Just before serving, bake breaded goat cheese rounds until warm throughout but not at all browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk dressing to re-blend and toss greens and dressing to coat in large mixing bowl. Divide dressed greens among 6 serving plates. Remove cheese rounds from oven; top each salad with one round and serve immediately.
