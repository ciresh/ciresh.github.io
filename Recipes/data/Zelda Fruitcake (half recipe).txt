3 egg yolks
3 egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup oil
3/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar

Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, oranges, limes and honeydew melon for decoration

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Spay and line 2 6" cake pans

In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, water, oil, vanilla extract and almond extract.

In a large bowl mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In another large bowl, beat egg whites until frothy then slowly add 2 tablespoons sugar while beating. Once combined, turn beater to high and beat until stiff peaks form.

Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and then fold in egg whites in 3 parts.

Pour the batter into cake pans and bake for 35 minutes.

Once cool, level cakes to 1 inch thick.

Cut strawberries into 4 equal slices and shingle them onto the top of the cut cake in circles. Pipe whipped cream in between the strawberries.

Place the second cake on top, cut side down, and frost the entire cake in whipped cream. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Cut cake into 6 slices and decorate cake with 3 rosettes on the edge of the slice. Decorate the top with fruit.
