Potato Salad Recipe - Kenji

4 pounds (1.8kg) russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch cubes
Kosher salt
1/4 cup sugar (1 3/4 ounces; 50g), divided
6 tablespoons (90ml) rice wine vinegar, divided
3 ribs celery, finely diced (about 1 cup)
1 medium (8-ounce; 225g) red onion, finely diced (about 1/2 cup)
4 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup, optional)
1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, washed and minced (optional)
1/4 cup chopped cornichons (see note)
2 tablespoons whole grain mustard (more or less to taste)
1 1/4 cups mayonnaise
Fresh ground black pepper


Add 2 quarts water to a large saucepan. Add potatoes, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 2 tablespoons vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Spread into even layer, then sprinkle with 2 tablespoons vinegar. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine remaining sugar, remaining vinegar, celery, onion, scallion (if using), parsley (if using), pickles, mustard, and mayonnaise. Stir with rubber spatula to combine. Fold in potatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and rest in fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days before serving.
