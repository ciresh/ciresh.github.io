African Chicken

3 lbs chicken breast

8 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 bay leaves, finely crumbled
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 hot chile peppers. finely chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 can (16 ounces) coconut milk

Combine the garlic, bay leaves, paprika, salt chile peppers, olive oil and coconut milk. Whisk together.

Place marinade over chicken and refrigerate overnight

Heat a teaspoon of olive oil oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, place chicken breasts in and cook until edges are opaque, about 10 minutes.

Flip to the other side, then cover the pan, lower the heat and cook for another 10 minutes.
Finally (and this is important) let the chicken rest for at least 5 minutes before you cut or all the juices you made the effort to keep will come running right out, resulting in a floavorless, rubbery, mass.
