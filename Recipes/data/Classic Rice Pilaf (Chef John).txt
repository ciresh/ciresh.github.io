Classic Rice Pilaf (Chef John)

1 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 medium onion, chopped
1 cups long-grain white rice
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
3/4 teaspoons salt
1 pinch saffron (Optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Melt butter and oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Place rice into a 8x8-inch dish. Add onion and stir until rice is thoroughly coated. Place the dish on a baking sheet.

Combine chicken stock, salt, and saffron in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.

Pour stock mixture over rice in the baking dish and stir to combine. Spread mixture evenly along the bottom of the pan and cover tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the foil and fluff rice with a fork.
