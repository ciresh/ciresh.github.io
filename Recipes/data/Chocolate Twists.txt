Chocolate Twists

For the dough 
300g (10.6oz) strong white bread flour
4g (0.14oz) dry yeast or 3x the amount of fresh yeast
5g (0.17oz) salt
20g (0.7oz) sugar
50g (1.75oz) soft butter
180g (6.3oz) cold milk

For the filling
100g (3.5oz) brown sugar
20g (0.7oz) cocoa powder
4g (0.14oz) cinnamon
70g (2.5oz) soft butter
1 egg yolk mixed with 1 teaspoon of milk for glazing.

Make the filling by beating together the brown sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon & butter. Keep aside for later.
In a bowl combine the milk, yeast, salt & sugar. Mix well to hydrate the yeast & dissolve the sugar. Add the flour and mix well. Tip the dough out of the bowl and knead for 3 minutes. Add the butter and knead for another 3 – 4 minutes. Desired dough temperature 25 – 26C (77-79F). If it is warmer it will ferment more quickly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing times accordingly.

Cover & ferment the dough for 45 – 60 minutes. Fold. Ferment for 45 – 60 minutes or until doubled.
Roll the dough to a large rectangle. Spread the filling in a thin layer leaving a 5cm (2in) edge on one end. Brush the end piece with water and fold the dough up in 3 layers.

Divide in 8 pieces. Cut a slit in each dough piece leaving the ends connected. Twist it in on itself from either end.
Place the chocolate twists on a parchment paper lined tray leaving gaps between them.
Cover & ferment for 1 hour. During this time preheat your oven to 160C (320F) dan on.
Brush with the egg yolk & milk glaze. Bake for 20 – 25 minutes or until golden brown all over.
