Chocolate Twists

For the dough 
300g  strong white bread flour
4g (1 1/2 teaspoon) dry yeast or 3x the amount of fresh yeast
5g (3/4 teaspoon) salt
20g (5 tablespoons) sugar
50g (3 1/2 tablespoons) soft butter
180g (3/4+ cups) cold milk

For the filling
100g brown sugar
20g cocoa powder
4g (2 teaspoons) cinnamon
70g (5 tablespoons) soft butter
1 egg yolk mixed with 1 teaspoon of milk for glazing.

Make the filling by beating together the brown sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon & butter. Keep aside for later.

In a bowl combine the milk, yeast, salt & sugar. Mix well to hydrate the yeast & dissolve the sugar. Add the flour and mix well. Tip the dough out of the bowl and knead for 3 minutes. Add the butter and knead for another 3 – 4 minutes. Desired dough temperature 25 – 26C (77-79F). If it is warmer it will ferment more quickly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing times accordingly.

Cover & ferment the dough for 45 – 60 minutes. Fold. Ferment for 45 – 60 minutes or until doubled.

Roll the dough to a large rectangle. Spread the filling in a thin layer leaving a 5cm (2in) edge on one end. Brush the end piece with water and fold the dough up in 3 layers.

Divide in 8 pieces. Cut a slit in each dough piece leaving the ends connected. Twist it in on itself from either end. Place the chocolate twists on a parchment paper lined tray leaving gaps between them. Cover & ferment for 1 hour. During this time preheat your oven to 160C (320F) fan on.

Brush with the egg yolk & milk glaze. Bake for 20 – 25 minutes or until golden brown all over.
