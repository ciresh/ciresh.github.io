Spiked and Spiced Apple Cider 

Serves 8 
Total Volume: 6 1/2 cups 

8 whole allspice berries 
10 cinnamon sticks 
32 ounces (4 cups) apple cider 
16 ounces (2 cups) brandy or whiskey 
4 ounces (1/2 cup) honey 

This warming drink, perfect for any autumn gathering, practically calls out for something sweet on the side, like shortbread or apple-cider donuts. At home, serve this concoction in a teapot- or just ladle it into mugs straight from the pot on the stove (everyone's is probably gathered in the kitchen anyways. Are pour it into a thermos and take it to a tailgate party to help keep folks toes warm 

Put the allspice berries and two of the cinnamon sticks in a square of cheesecloth and secure with kitchen twine creating a spice sachet

In a large saucepan combine the apple cider, brandy, and honey and stir until thoroughly blended. Add the spice sachet cover and bring to a boil over medium high heat, then lower the heat and similar stirring occasionally for five minutes. Remove from the heat and stir again. Discard the spice sachet. To serve ladle into glass mugs and garnish each drink with a cinnamon stick.
