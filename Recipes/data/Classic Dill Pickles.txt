Classic Dill Pickles

2 lb. kirby cucumbers, quartered
10 large sprigs dill
1 cup white distilled vinegar
2 Tbsp. kosher salt
2 tsp. sugar
2 tsp. black peppercorns
2 tsp. caraway seeds

Two 1-qt. canning jars with lids

Divide cucumbers and dill between jars. Bring vinegar, salt, sugar, peppercorns, caraway seeds, and 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve salt and sugar. Pour hot brine into jars, dividing evenly, and cover. Let cool, then chill.

Do Ahead: Cucumbers can be pickled 2 months ahead. Keep chilled.
