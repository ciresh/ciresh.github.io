Bobotie (South African Beef Casserole)

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 large onion, diced
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
5 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 pounds ground beef
4 bay laurel leaves, divided
1 rounded tablespoon tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 
1/3 cup Indian-style fruit chutney, or to taste
3 slices white bread, crusts removed
1 1/2 cups milk, divided
2 large eggs
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Heat olive oil and butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add onions and salt, and cook until just beginning to soften and turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.

Stir in curry powder, cumin, turmeric, black pepper, and oregano, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. 

Add ground beef, and cook, stirring, while breaking the meat up into small crumbles. Add 1 bay leaf, tomato paste, and garlic, and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes.

Stir in lemon juice and zest, vinegar, Worcestershire, and chutney. Smooth the top, and simmer mixture gently for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, add bread to a bowl and cover with 1/2 cup of milk, toss, and let stand for 5 minutes. Squeeze excess milk back into the bowl and add soaked bread to meat. Mash, smash and stir mixture until bread is thoroughly blended in. 

Add remaining 1 cup milk to the bowl; add eggs, cayenne, and pinch of salt, and whisk thoroughly. Pour gently over meat, and top with 3 or more bay leaves. 


Bake in the preheated oven until custard on top is set and lightly golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
