3 Egg Whites (at room temperature)
1/4 cup white sugar (50 g)
2 cups confectioners sugar (200 g)
1 cup almond flour (120 g)
pinch of salt
1/4 tsp cream of tartar (2 ml)
RASPBERRY BUTTER CREAM
1/4 cup salted butter (60g)
3/4eokf,:"d;LmdkoKsLksL  cup powdered sugar (75 g)
1 cup (150 g) fresh raspberries, worked through a sieve to extract 3 tbsp of juice

Preheat oven to 300F degrees

Beat egg whites until foamy, then add salt, cream of tartar and white sugar for 8-10 mins. TIP: #1 egg whites should be room temp. To create room temp eggs, submerge in warm water for 5 mins.

Whip until they form a peak that stands upright. Think Seattle Space needle. Then add the food coloring.

Sift almond flour, and powdered sugar. Fold flour/sugar mixture into the egg white mixture. 65-75 turns of your spatula when folding is about the right amount of time. 
Transfer batter to a pastry bag.
Tap the pan hard at least 2-3 times to release the air bubbles.

Let them sit out for 20-30 mins, or up to an hour if you want.

Bake for 20 mins. DO NOT UNDER BAKE

Meanwhile mix the buttercream. Whip butter with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Slowly add sugar. Then place sieve on top of a bowl the same size. Work raspberries through the sieve with a spatula, pushing them through, mashing them around until you extract their juice. You want 3 tablespoons of juice.

Add juice to buttercream, and whip until combined. Transfer to a pastry bag, fitted with a small tip (about 1/4 " in diameter)
Reverse cookie shells on their backs, and pipe a small mound of filling on one of them. Top with the other shell et Voila!
