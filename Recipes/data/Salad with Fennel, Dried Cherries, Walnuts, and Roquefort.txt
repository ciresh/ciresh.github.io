Salad with Fennel, Dried Cherries, Walnuts, and Roquefort

11/2004

We tried a half-dozen varieties of blue cheese and all were acceptable, but tasters favored rich, creamy Roquefort. If you prefer to use a very mild and mellow blue cheese, we recommend Danish blue; if you prefer a sharp and piquant one, try Stilton.

Serves 6 as a first course
2 teaspoons honey 
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
1/2 cup dried sweet cherries or cranberries
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
Table salt and ground black pepper 
1 small bulb fennel , trimmed of stalks and sliced very thin (about 1 1/2 cups), fronds chopped coarse (about 1/4 cup)
1 small head red leaf lettuce (or green), washed, dried, and torn into bite-size pieces (7 cups)
1 small head radicchio , quartered, cored, and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-wide strips (about 3 cups)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts , toasted in medium skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes
6 ounces Roquefort cheese , crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups)


1. Whisk honey and vinegar in medium microwave-safe bowl; stir in cherries. Cover with plastic wrap, cut several steam vents in plastic, and microwave on high until cherries are plump, about 1 minute. Whisk in oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; while mixture is still warm, add sliced fennel bulb and toss to combine. Let cool to room temperature.

2. Toss lettuce, radicchio, fennel fronds, and dried cherry/fennel mixture in large bowl; adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Divide salad among individual plates; top each with portion of nuts and Roquefort. Serve immediately.
