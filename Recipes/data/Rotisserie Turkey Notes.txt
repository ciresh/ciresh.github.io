Rotisserie Turkey Notes

11 lb. Shady Brook Farm 

1:45 - Started
3:39 - Breast was 150
4:15 - Done

2:30 Hours totals (13 min/lb)

Turkey bearly fit, had to remove flavorizer. Aluminum pan fit between bars.

Outer burners at 50% cooked at 325. However should cook at high temp as skin wasn't as crisp. Perhaps start hotter, then reduce.

Tank was 26.48 at start. Finish was 24.80 So used 1.68 lb of propane. Using 1 gallon = 4.10 lb, it used .4 gallons of propane. At 3.99/gallon, $1.60 of propane.

11.5 x 9 x 2.25 pan fit nice
