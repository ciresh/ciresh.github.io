Mango Cake Recipe

3 Egg yolks
45ml Milk (3 tbsp)
35ml Vegetable oil (2 tbsp 1 tsp)
40g Cornstarch (⅓ cup)
40g All-purpose flour (40 g)
3 Egg whites
65g White sugar (⅓ cup)
Pinch of salt

480ml Thickened cream
100g White sugar (½ cup)
1 tsp Vanilla extract

2 large mangoes

Preheat the oven to 160°C fan forced

Line the bottom of a 6-inch cake tin with parchment paper

In a medium-sized bowl whisk the egg yolks, milk, vegetable oil and cornstarch together

Sift in the flour and salt, and whisk until just combined

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment whip the egg whites with sugar until stiff peaks

In three additions fold the meringue into the egg yolk mixture, being careful not to deflate the bubbles

Transfer the cake batter to the cake tin

Fill a larger baking tray with 1cm of boiling water and place the cake tin in the tray

Bake for 60 minutes, or until it springs back when touched

Cool on a wire rack

Once cooled run a knife around the edge of the cake tin and invert the pan

Wrap in cling wrap and place in the fridge until assembly


Vanilla whipped cream

Combine the cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whisk until medium stiff peaks.

Reserve in the fridge until assembly


Assembly

Peel the mangoes and cut one mango into 6 large cubes

Thinly slice the remaining mango

Cut the cake into three equal layers

Place a cake layer on a turn table and spread over a thin layer of cream

Place the thinly sliced pieces of mango over the cream and top with more cream

Top with another sheet of sponge

Repeat and cover with the final sponge layer

Using a palette knife spread cover the cake in a thin layer of cream, spinning the 
turntable as you go to create a smooth finish

Place the remaining cream in a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe a border around the edge of the cake

Decorate with the cubes of mango and place in the fridge to set for 1-2 hours before enjoying
