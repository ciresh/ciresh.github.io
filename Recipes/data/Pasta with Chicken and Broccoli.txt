Pasta with Chicken and Broccoli



1/4 cup butter
1/2 (4 ounce) package cream cheese
1 teaspoons garlic powder
1 cups milk 
1.5 ounces grated Cheese
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

1/2 lb Pasta
1 Head of Broccoli
1 1/2 - 2 Chicken Breasts 

Blanch Broccoli until desired tenderness

Cook Pasta (same water?)

Cooks chicken in pan then remove to make sauce

Melt butter in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat. Add cream cheese and garlic powder, stirring with a wire whisk until smooth. Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps. Stir in Parmesan cheese and pepper. 

Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistency. Sauce will thicken rapidly. Thin with milk if cooked too long.

Toss with hot pasta to serve.
