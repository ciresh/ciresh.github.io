Partial thawing of the spinach produces a cold dip that can be served without further chilling. If you don?t own a microwave, the frozen spinach can be thawed at room temperature for 11/2 hours then squeezed of excess liquid. The garlic must be minced or pressed before going into the food processor; otherwise the dip will contain large chunks of garlic.
