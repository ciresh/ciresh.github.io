Chef John's Cast Iron Cornbread

4-8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon fine salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons honey, or to taste (or 1/4 brown sugar)
2 large eggs
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1 cup self-rising flour 
2 teaspoons baking powder, 
3/4 cup frozen corn kernals (optional, blend into wet ingredients)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Melt butter in a cast iron skillet. Turn off heat and set butter aside until needed.

Combine cornmeal, salt, cayenne, honey, eggs, and buttermilk. Whisk to combine. Add flour and 1/2 the butter from the pan; whisk again. Pour batter over the remaining butter in the skillet

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool briefly before slicing.
