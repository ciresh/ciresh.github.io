Sweet Dark Cherry Cobbler

Ingredients
For the filling:
1/2 cup sugar
2 Tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 Teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 cup water
1 twelve ounce bag frozen pitted dark sweet cherries, thawed
1 Tablespoon butter

For the topping:
1 cup flour
1/4 cup white sugar,divided
2 Teaspoons baking powder
1/2 Teaspoon salt
3 Tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup milk
Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter an 8 inch baking dish.



Make the filling:
Using a large saucepan combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon. Stir in the water until the mixture is well blended and smooth. Add the thawed cherries and butter to the pan. Cook on low heat until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil. The mixture will thicken first then come to a boil. Don't be tempted to turn the heat up to speed the process. Place the filling into the buttered baking dish

Make the topping:
Mix the flour, 2 Tablespoons sugar,baking powder and salt in a large bowl.  Using a pastry blended work the shortening into the dry ingredients until you have coarse crumbs. Stir the milk into the crumb mixture just until moistened. Drop the topping over the filling in tablespoons full until cherries are covered. Sprinkle the remaining 2 Tablespoons of sugar over the topping evenly. Bake 30-35 minutes until topping is golden brown.
