High Heat Brisket (4-5 hours)

Jim's All-Night Brisket Rub
2 Tablespoons granulated sugar (don't use for high heat)
2 Tablespoons ground black pepper
2 Tablespoons sweet paprika
2 Tablespoons pure chili pepper powder (e.g. ancho)	
2 teaspoons onion salt
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons celery salt
2 teaspoons seasoning salt

Modified Louis Charles Henley's All-Purpose Rub
6 Tablespoons Lawry's Seasoning Salt
1 Tablespoon + 1-1/2 teaspoons finely ground black pepper
1 Tablespoon granulated garlic
1 Tablespoon paprika
1-1/2 teaspoons chili powder

No. 5 Sauce
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon worchestershire sauce
1 tablespoon rub
Opional but v. good: 1/4 cup meat drippings
Simmer to marry the flavors and thicken as desired.

Whole, untrimmed 10-12 pound USDA Select or ungraded packer brisket.
Trim fat at the seam between the point and flat sections. Trim the fat side to about 1/4" thick.
Apply your favorite rub and refrigerate overnight.

Fill the charcoal chamber to the top with unlit Kingsford charcoal briquettes. Light 3/4 of a chimney starter of charcoal (about 75 briquettes) and then spread the hot coals over the unlit ones.

Foil the inside of the water pan, then line with a second sheet of foil suspended about 1" above the bottom of pan. The air space created will help prevent the brisket drippings from burning during the high-heat cook.

Cook the brisket fat-side down at 325-375°F for 2 to 2-1/2 hours to an internal temperature of 170°F.
Wrap in foil fat-side up and cook another 2 to 2-1/2 hours until fork tender.
Rest in foil for 30 minutes before slicing.

To hold the brisket at temperature for several hours before serving, skip the 30 minute rest, wrap the foiled brisket with towels, and place in a cooler. This should keep the meat at a food-safe temperature of 140°F or higher for 2-3 hours.
