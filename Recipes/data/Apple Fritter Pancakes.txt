Apple Fritter Pancakes

2 large egg
2 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
2 pinch ground ginger
2 pinch nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup shredded apple
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
4 tablespoons melted butter

Combine egg, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, kosher salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Whisk until well combined and lightly foamy. Add shredded apple and lemon juice and fold in with a spatula until well combined. Add flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix until flour disappears and batter is thick yet spoonable.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add tablespoonfuls of apple batter to the hot butter and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until apple pancakes spring back to the touch and are browned on the other side, an additional 3 minutes.
