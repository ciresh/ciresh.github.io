Glazed Chocolate Donuts

For the donuts
1 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup natural cocoa powder
1/4 cup mini chocolate chips optional
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
6 tablespoons sour cream
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

For the glaze
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, baking soda, and salt.

In a small bowl, beat together the vanilla, egg, sour cream, milk, and oil.

Stir the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined.

Spoon in a greased donut pan.

Bake for 8 minutes or until the tops spring back when you touch them.

Let the donuts cool in the pan before glazing.

Whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth.

Dunk the donuts in the glaze to fully coat and place on a wire rack to set, about 5 minutes.
