Spanish-Style Hot Chocolate

4 ounces dark chocolate (70% cacao), broken or cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 1/4 cups whole milk
2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste
1 pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch


Break up chocolate into small pieces and set aside.

Add milk, sugar, salt, and cornstarch to a saucepan, and whisk thoroughly.

Place over medium to medium-high heat, and cook stirring until the milk just starts to simmer.

Remove milk from heat, and quickly whisk in chocolate until completely melted and emulsified.
