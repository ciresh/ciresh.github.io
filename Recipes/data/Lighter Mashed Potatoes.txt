SERVES 4
This recipe yields smooth mashed potatoes. If you don't mind (or prefer) lumps, use a potato masher. Mashed potatoes stiffen and become gluey as they cool, so they are best served piping hot. If you must hold mashed potatoes before serving, place them in a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and set the bowl over a pot of simmering water. Be sure to occasionally check the water level in the pan. The potatoes will remain hot and soft-textured for 1 hour.
INGREDIENTS
2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 medium), scrubbed, peeled, and cut into chunks
Salt
3/4 cup 2% milk, warmed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup low-fat sour cream
Ground black pepper
INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place the potatoes and 1 tablespoon salt in a large saucepan and add enough water to cover the potatoes by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until a fork can be slipped easily into the center of the potatoes, about 18 minutes. Drain the potatoes.
2. Set a food mill or ricer over the now-empty but still-warm saucepan. Working in batches, drop the potatoes into the hopper of the food mill or ricer and process into the saucepan.
3. Stir in the milk and melted butter with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Gently fold in the sour cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.
