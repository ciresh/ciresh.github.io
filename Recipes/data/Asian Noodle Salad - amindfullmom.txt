Asian Noodle Salad

8 ounces spaghetti noodles
3 cups broccoli slaw
1 cup thinly sliced red or yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1/2 cup chopped cilantro optional
1 tablespoon sesame seeds optional

1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey or agave, brown sugar, or maple syrup
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon grated ginger root
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 

To prepare the dressing, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes together in a large mixing bowl. Set aside
Bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil. Add a large pinch of salt and pasta to the water once boiling. Cook the noodles according to package directions. Once the noodles are cooked, drain well in a colander but do not rinse the noodles.
Add the pasta to the large bowl with the prepared dressing and toss to coat. Allow the noodles to cool slightly (10-15 minutes) before adding the vegetables.
Add the broccoli slaw, peppers, green onions, and cilantro, if using, to the noodles and toss to combine.
