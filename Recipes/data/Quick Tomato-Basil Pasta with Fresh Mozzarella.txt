Look for fresh mini mozzarella balls in the gourmet cheese section of your supermarket.

Serves 4
3 	tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
4 	cloves garlic , minced
1/4 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
	1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes 
	1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes 
5 	tablespoons roughly chopped fresh basil 
1/4 	teaspoon sugar 
	Table salt 
1 	pound campanelle or fusilli pasta
8 	ounces fresh mini mozzarella balls , drained and cut in half
1/3 	cup grated Parmesan cheese 


1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot.

2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, and pepper flakes in medium saucepan over medium heat until fragrant but not brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in crushed and diced tomatoes, bring to simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons basil, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

3. Add 1 tablespoon salt and pasta to boiling water. Cook until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, drain pasta, and transfer back to pot. Stir in sauce and remaining tablespoon oil, and cook over medium heat until heated through (adding reserved water if pasta seems dry), about 1 minute. Stir in mozzarella and season with salt. Serve, sprinkling with remaining 2 tablespoons basil and Parmesan.
