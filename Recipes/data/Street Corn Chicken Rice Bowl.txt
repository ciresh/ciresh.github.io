Ingredients:

For the Chicken:
2 large chicken breasts, sliced thin
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the Corn Mixture:

2 cups corn kernels (fresh, frozen, or canned, drained)
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese (or feta cheese)
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro

For the Bowl:

2 cups cooked rice (white, brown, or cilantro-lime rice)
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1 avocado, sliced

Directions:

Marinate and Cook the Chicken:

In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, chili powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Rub the mixture onto both sides of the chicken slices.

Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and charred in spots. Set aside to rest, then slice into strips.

Prepare the Corn Mixture:

In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the corn kernels, smoked paprika, and chili powder, and cook for 3-4 minutes until the corn is lightly browned.
In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked corn, cotija cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and chopped cilantro. Mix until well combined.

Assemble the Rice Bowls:
Divide the cooked rice among serving bowls. Top with slices of grilled chicken, the street corn mixture, diced tomatoes, and avocado slices.

Garnish and Serve:

Garnish with additional cilantro and serve with lime wedges for extra zing. Enjoy this bold, satisfying rice bowl for lunch or dinner!
