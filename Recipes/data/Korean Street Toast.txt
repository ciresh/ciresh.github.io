Korean Street Toast

1 cup thinly sliced green cabbage
1/3 cup julienned carrot
1 stalk green onion, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons salted butter, divided
2 thick slices white bread
1/2 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
2 thin slices smoked ham
1 slice mild Cheddar cheese 
1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste
1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or to taste


Mix cabbage, carrot, green onion, salt, pepper, and cayenne with your hands in a bowl until soft, about 30 seconds. Mix in eggs with a fork until thoroughly combined.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add bread slices and flip a few times to make sure both sides are coated with butter. Grill bread until beautifully toasted, golden brown, and a little crispy on both sides. Transfer to a plate.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage mixture; cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form it into a rectangle that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half into two square patties; continue to cook until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side.

Stack patties on top of one another onto one slice of toast and sprinkle with sugar.

Place ham slices into the hot skillet; cook over medium heat until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and top with Cheddar slice; cook until melted, about 1 minute.

Place ham and cheese on top of patties; top with ketchup, mayonnaise, and remaining slice of toast. Cut in half and serve.
