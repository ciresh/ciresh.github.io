Pumpkin Spice Latte Sweet Potato Pie

21 ounces sweet potatoes (2 to 3 medium)
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 large eggs
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon grains of paradise, ground in spice grinder, peppermill, of mortar & pestle
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (9-inch) Premade Pie Crust (fully baked and cooled)

Heat the oven to 400°F.

Place the sweet potatoes on a quarter sheet pan or baking dish and roast until fork-tender, about 1 hour. Transfer to a plate and let sit at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F.

Peel off the skin from the potatoes and discard it. Weigh the sweet potato flesh; you should have between 13 1/2 and 14 ounces (380 and 400 grams). Transfer the sweet potato flesh to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Turn the mixer off, add the sugar and beat on medium-low another 30 seconds. Turn the mixer off again and add the eggs, cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, cardamom, grains of paradise, and salt. Return the mixer to medium-high and continue to beat until smooth with no sugar visible, about 30 seconds.

Place a large fine-mesh sieve over a medium bowl, then pour the sweet potato mixture through the sieve. Use a rubber spatula to press the filling through the sieve and strain out any sweet potato fibers; it will take some effort but is well worth it for a smooth pie. Transfer to the pie crust and smooth the top.

Bake until the pie just jiggles slightly in the center and has reached an internal temperature of 165 to 175 degrees F, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. Serve at room temp or chill completely before slicing. Stash any leftovers covered and refrigerated.
