Ube Cupcakes (unlikely baker)

For the Ube Cupcakes:
2 pcs large eggs room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup canola oil or vegetable oil
1 cup ube jam 1 heaping cup, see notes
3 tsp ube extract
1 cup cake flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt

For the Ube Whipped Cream Frosting:
1 tsp unflavoured gelatine
2 tbsp cold water
1 cup heavy cream chilled
3 tbsp granulated sugar
1 tbsp ube extract

In a large bowl, whisk 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup canola oil until combined.

Add ube jam and whisk until you don’t see any ube jam chunks remaining.

Add 3 tsp ube extract and continue whisking until combined.

Sift 1 cup cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt into your ube mixture.

Gently stir just until combined. Do not over mix. If you no longer see massive streaks of flour, you’re OK.

Scoop batter into prepared liners, filling them a little over 1/2 full.

Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a few of the cupcakes comes out with minimal dry crumbs and the tops spring back when lightly pressed.

Remove from pan and cool on a rack completely before frosting.

To make the ube whipped cream frosting, in a small bowl or measuring cup, sprinkle 1 tsp gelatine into 2 tbsp cold water and set aside to bloom (about 2 minutes). Do not stir.

In the meantime, using a handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, start whipping 1 cup heavy cream with 3 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp ube extract on medium speed until you reach medium peaks.

Go back to your gelatine and microwave for 10 seconds to dissolve. Stir to combine and bring down to room temperature.

Add a dollop of your whipped cream into the gelatine to temper it. Then add the tempered gelatine to your whipped cream and continue whisking until you reach stiff peaks.

Frost and decorate cupcakes as desired.
