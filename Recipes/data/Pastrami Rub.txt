Pastrami Rub 

3 Tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, slightly coarse grind
1 teaspoon freshly ground coriander seeds, slightly coarse grind
1 teaspoon granulated garlic

Assemble the cooker and put the brisket on the top cooking grate fat-side down.

Cook the brisket until it reaches an average internal temperature of 165Â°. Take the meat's temperature in several spots and average the results. It will read higher or lower in different spots depending on the thickness of the meat.
