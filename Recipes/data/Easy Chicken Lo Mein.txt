INSTRUCTIONS
MAKE THE SAUCE:
In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, hoisin sauce and sesame oil. Set the sauce aside.

MAKE THE LO MEIN:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the lo mein noodles and cook until al dente. Drain and set aside.

In a large nonstick sauté pan set over medium heat, add the olive oil and sesame oil. Once hot, add the garlic and chicken and cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.

Add the carrots and snow peas to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach, cooked noodles, chicken and prepared sauce to the pan and cook, stirring, until combined and the spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.

KELLY’S NOTE:
You can find lo mein noodles in the Asian foods section of most major supermarkets. If you can’t find lo mein, you can substitute linguine or spaghetti.
