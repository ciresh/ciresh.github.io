Instant Homemade Cocoa    Add to Favorites

Brenda Locklear of Wilmington, N.C., gave us the idea for making quick individual servings of homemade hot cocoa. We adapted our recipe (from January/February 1997), omitting the dairy component, to make a cocoa "base."

To make four servings, whisk together 6 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa, 5 tablespoons sugar, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Heat mixture over low heat for two minutes, stirring frequently. Cool to room temperature, then store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to three weeks. Multiply the recipe as needed.

When the mood strikes for a nice hot cup of cocoa, simply add 3 to 4 tablespoons of the cocoa base to 8 ounces of hot milk and stir.
