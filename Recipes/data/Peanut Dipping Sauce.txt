The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Serve at room temperature.

Makes about 3/4 cup
1/4 	cup smooth peanut butter 
1/4 	cup hoisin sauce 
1/4 	cup water 
2 	tablespoons tomato paste 
1 	teaspoon Asian chili sauce 
2 	teaspoons peanut oil or vegetable oil
2 	medium heads garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press
1 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
	


Whisk peanut butter, hoisin sauce, water, tomato paste, and chili sauce, if using, in small bowl. Heat oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes in small saucepan over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in peanut butter mixture; bring to simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 3 minutes. (Sauce should have ketchup-like consistency; if too thick, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until proper consistency is reached.) Transfer to bowl; cool to room temperature.
