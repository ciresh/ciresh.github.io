Tzatziki Sauce

1 cup Greek yogurt
1/4 cup sour cream
1 cucumber unpeeled and seeded
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 TBS white balsamic vinegar
1 TBS lemon juice
1/2 TBS olive oil
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp dill (minced fresh, or dried)
Pinch freshly ground black pepper

Instructions 

To strain the yogurt/sour cream:
Place a fine mesh strainer on top of a smaller bowl (to catch the water as it drains). Be sure that the strainer does not touch the bottom of the bowl and that there is at least 1-2 inches between them.
Put a coffee filter on top of the strainer.

Mix 1 cup Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup sour cream together. Carefully scoop it onto the coffee filter/strainer and place it in the fridge overnight or for at least 4 hours.

To strain the cucumber:

De-seed and grate your cucumber. Put it in a colander over a bowl and sprinkle with salt.
Let it sit on the counter for at least 2 hours, occasionally pushing out the excess water.

Putting it together:

When youâ€™re ready to make the sauce: squeeze out all excess water from cucumber by pushing it out while in the colander. Then get some thick paper towels, put cucumber in them and ring it out.
Put yogurt mixture in a clean, dry mixing bowl. Add all ingredients except cucumber. Once thoroughly mixed add cucumber and refrigerate for at least one hour to let flavors blend.
Serve with your favorite Mediterranean food like falafel or gyros!
