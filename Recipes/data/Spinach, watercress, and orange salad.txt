Spinach, watercress, and orange salad

4 ounces baby spinach (about 5 1/3 cups lightly packed)
4 ounces watercress (or arugula), washed, dried, and stemmed (about 4 cups lightly packed)
3/4 cup sliced almonds
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 medium red onion, sliced thin
1 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced
Table salt
2 large oranges, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar

Toss the spinach and watercress together in a large bowl; set aside

Toast the almonds in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant and lightly browned, about 3 minutes; transfer them to the bowl with the greens. Wipe out the skillet using a wad of paper towels

Add the olive oil, onion, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the skillet and return to mediium-high heat; cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 1 minute. Add the oranges and vinegar to the pan and swirl to incorporate. Remove from the heat.

Pour the warm dressing over the salad mixture and gently toss to wilt. Serve immediately.
