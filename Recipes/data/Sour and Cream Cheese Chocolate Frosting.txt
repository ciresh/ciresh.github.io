Chocolate Frosting (from Martha Stewart via Annie Eats)
http://www.crumblycookie.net/2011/02/17/chocolate-frosting-comparison/

13 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
2 2/3 cups (10.75 ounces) confectioners’ sugar, sifted
5 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
Pinch of salt
1 cup sour cream

1. Melt the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Set aside to cool until just barely warm.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Gradually mix in the confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder and salt. Beat in the melted and cooled chocolate and then the sour cream. Continue beating until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Frost cupcakes immediately.
