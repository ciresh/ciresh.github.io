Curried Chicken Salad

1/2 cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's or Duke's
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, from 1 lime
3/4 teaspoon salt
41/2 cups cooked shredded chicken (see note)
3 large stalks celery, diced
1 cup seedless grapes, halved
3 scallions, light and dark green parts, finely sliced
Pinch cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
2/3 cup salted cashews

INSTRUCTIONS

Make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, curry powder, honey, lime juice, and salt.

To the dressing, add the chicken, celery, grapes and scallions. Toss well to combine, then taste and adjust seasoning, adding the cayenne pepper, if desired. Cover the chicken salad with plastic wrap and chill until ready to serve. Right before serving, stir in the cashews (adding them at the last minute ensures they stay crunchy).

Note: I use poached chicken for this recipe. If you'd like to use roasted chicken, you'll need 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the chicken breasts skin-side up on the prepared baking sheet. Coat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle both sides with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, or until done. Let cool. (You may also use a rotisserie chicken.)

Make-Ahead Instructions: This salad can be made and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Wait to add the cashews until right before serving, otherwise they will get soft.
