TECHNIQUE: CUTTING PITA CHIPS
1. Using kitchen shears, cut around the perimeter of each pita bread to yield 2 thin rounds.
2. Stack the pita rounds and, using a chef's knife, cut them into 6 wedges each.

Recipe:
1. Adjust the oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the pita wedges, smooth-side down, over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Brush each chip lightly with oil and sprinkle with salt.

2. Bake the chips until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Flip the chips so their smooth side is up. Continue to bake until the chips are fully toasted, about 6 minutes longer. Cool the chips before serving.
