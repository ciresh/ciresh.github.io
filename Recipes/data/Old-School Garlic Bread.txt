PREPARATION

Preheat oven to 450°F. Heat butter and oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is completely melted.
Slice bread in half lengthwise, then place on a baking sheet and brush cut sides with butter mixture.
Slice crosswise 1" thick, without cutting all the way through; season with salt and top with Parmesan. Bake until golden, 10–15 minutes.
