No-Knead Sourdough Bread

For the leaven –

50g (1.75oz) strong white bread flour
50g (1.75oz) room temperature water if your kitchen is around 20-22C (68-71F)
10g  (0.35oz) active sourdough starter

*This is a 1:5:5 ratio and I know that my leaven will be ready in 10-12 hours. Keep in mind that every starter is different and yours may be more or less active than mine.

For the dough –

240g (8.5oz) strong white bread flour
50g (1.75oz) wholemeal flour
7g (0.25oz) sea salt
190g (6.7oz) water at around 26C (F) if your kitchen is around 20-22C (68-71F). This is quite a high temperature, but it is appropriate as we are not kneading this dough. The final dough temperature will in fact be lower because my flour is cooler.

Make the leaven. Mix the flour, starter, and water. Stir well. Cover and leave to ferment for around 10-12 hours or until doubled in volume and bubbly.

In a bowl add the remaining water and salt. Stir to dissolve the salt. As we are not kneading, we need to make sure that all the ingredients are dispersed evenly throughout the dough as we mix them.
Add the leaven and wholemeal flour. Mix well once again. Add the remaining white flour. Mix this to a dough. Use your hands to mix it all well together.

Scrape the dough together, shape into a ball. *Desired dough temperature 25C (77F). If your dough is warmer, then it will ferment more rapidly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing time accordingly.

Cover & rest for 20 minutes. Fold #1. Rest for 20 minutes. Fold #2. Rest for 20 minutes. Final fold. Ferment for 3 hours or until almost doubled in volume. Do a light pre-shape. Rest the dough for 30 minutes.

Shape it tight using the stitching method. Place the loaf in a floured breadbasket. Final proof 1.5 hours. During this time preheat your oven and baking vessel to 240C (F) fan off.

Place the loaf on your preheated pan and score it with a razor or a sharp knife.

Bake for 20 minutes with the lid on. Remove the lid and bake for 15 minutes.
