Worlds Best Baked Chicken

Ingredients
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast Kim NOTE:  THIS is great with BONE-in breasts too â€“ just bake a bit longer.
Butter for Greasing Pan
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 TBSP Red Wine Vinegar or Apple Cider Vinegar
1 TBSP Dry Ground Mustard (I like Colemans)
1 tsp Minced Garlic
1 tsp Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning (or any creole seasoning)
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Black Pepper
 
Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 Degrees. Mix sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Place Chicken breast in a foil lined baking pan that has been buttered. Pour Sauce over chicken and bake for 45 minutes or until
Chicken is done enough for your liking. ( I like 155 and then let it rest)

Every 15 minutes, I turn the Chicken Breasts over and baste with the sauce in the bottom of the pan. If you like the sauce to caramelize  then bake a bit longer. The aluminum foil also helps with the caramelization.

I serve with mashed potatoes and green beans.  DELCIOUS!
