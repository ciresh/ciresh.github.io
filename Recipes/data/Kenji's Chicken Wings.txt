Kenji's Chicken Wings

For the Wings:

2 pounds (900g) chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats
2 teaspoons (10g) baking powder
2 teaspoons (10g) kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight
2 teaspoons (10g) cornstarch
2 tablespoons neutral oil such as canola or vegetable

For the Sauce:

4 tablespoons (50g) unsalted butter
2-6 cloves garlic (adoring to taste), freshly minced
4 tablespoons (60ml) Frank's RedHot Sauce
Blue cheese dressing, for serving
Celery sticks, for serving

Directions

1. For the Wings: Carefully dry chicken wings with paper towels. In a large bowl, combine wings with baking powder, salt, and corn starch and toss until thoroughly and evenly coated. Place on rack, leaving a slight space between each wing. Transfer to the fridge.

Place baking sheet with wings in refrigerator and allow to rest, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.

2. When Ready to Bake: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Transfer wings to a large bowl and toss with an extra 2 tablespoons of oil. Retain them to the sheet pan (rack optional) and cook for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 30 minutes longer, flipping a few more times towards the end.

3. For the Sauce: Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until melted, then add garlic and cook until fragrant but not browned, about a minutes. Add the Frank’s whisking until combined. Transfer wings to a large bowl, add sauce, and toss to thoroughly coat. Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, conspicuously shunning anyone who says that real Buffalo wings must be fried.
