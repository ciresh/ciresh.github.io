Braised Daikon with Beef 
Makes 4 servings

1 Tbsp. canola oil
1/2 lb. ground beef
1 clove garlic, minced
1 green onion, chopped with light and dark green parts separated
1/2 large daikon, cut into quarters lengthwise, then into 1.5 inch pieces
4 Tbsp. sake
1 Tbsp. sugar
4 Tbsp. shoyu
pinch ground white pepper
1 Tbsp. katakuriko (potato starch)
2 tsp. sesame oil

In a wok or large pan with lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and break up into pieces as it cooks. When the meat is no longer pink, add the garlic, white parts of the green onion, and daikon. Stir well to make sure the daikon is coated in oil. Next, add the sake and a scant 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes over low heat.

Add sugar, shoyu, and white pepper and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover again, reduce heat to low, and cook for 10 minutes more. Meanwhile dissolve the katakuriko in 2 Tbsp. of water.

Drizzle the katakuriko mixture to the daikon and quickly stir until the sauce will thickens. Turn off the heat, add the sesame oil, toss, top with green onions and serve.
