French Apple Cake

3 large baking apples (such as Honeycrisp), cubed (about 4 cups)
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons dark rum
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons white sugar for the top
1 tablespoon powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper.

Peel and core apples, and cut into cubes between 1/4 and 3/8-inch in size. A little smaller is okay, but if your cubes are any larger, they wonâ€™t get tender enough when baked.  Add to a large bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.

Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
In another bowl, beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg on high speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Add the second egg and repeat. Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the flour mixture.  When the flour disappears add the rest, and fold in with a spatula.

Fold in apples until evenly mixed into the batter. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, making sure all the batter is pressed in firmly. Smooth top and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Remove cake from oven and let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Invert cooled cake onto a wire rack, place a serving plate on top, and flip back over. Dust top with powdered sugar and serve.
