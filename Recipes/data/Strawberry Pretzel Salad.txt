Strawberry Pretzel Salad

6 oz strawberry Jell-O
2 cups boiling water
2 1/2 cups salted pretzels, (measured before crushing)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
8 Tbsp unsalted butter
8 oz package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
8 oz cool whip, thawed in the fridge
1 lb fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced

Pre-heat oven to 350°F. Combine strawberry Jell-O with 2 cups boiling water and stir until completely dissolved. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

Crush 2 1/2 cups pretzels in a sturdy ziploc bag, using a rolling pin.

In a medium sauce pan, melt 8 Tbsp butter then add 1/4 cup sugar and stir. Mix in crushed pretzels. Transfer to a 13x9 glass casserole dish, pressing the pretzel mix evenly over the bottom of the dish and bake for 10 min at 350°F, then cool to room temp.

When pretzels have cooled, use an electric hand mixer to beat 8 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar on med/high speed until fluffy and white. Fold in 8 oz Cool Whip until no streaks of cream cheese remain. Spread mixture over cooled pretzels, spreading to the edges of the dish to create a tight seal. Refrigerate 30 min.

Hull and slice 1 lb strawberries then stir into your room temperature jello. Pour and spread strawberry jello mixture evenly over your cooled cream cheese layer and refrigerate until jello is set (2-4 hours).


Whipped Cream Sub: Although this substitution tastes good, it softens the pretzel crust so the crust isn’t as crisp. Beat 1 cup heavy whipping cream until stiff and fluffy. Add 2/3 cup sugar to the cream cheese to reach the same sweetness and refrigerate the cream portion for 45 minutes for it to set better.
