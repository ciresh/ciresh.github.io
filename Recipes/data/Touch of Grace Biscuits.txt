Touch of Grace Biscuits

Non stick cooking spray
2 cups Southern self-rising flour
1/8 tsp baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
4 tablespoons shortening
2/3 cup heavy or whipping cream
1 cup buttermilk, or until dough resembles cottage cheese
1 cup bleached all-purpose flour for shaping
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and spay an 8- or 9-inch rouch cake pan with nonstick cooking spay.

Combine the self-rising flour, salt, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl. With your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the shortening into the four mixtures until there are no shortening lumps larger than a big pea.

Stir the cream and buttermilk and let stand for 2 or 3 minutes. This dough is so wet that you cannot shape it in the usual manner. It will look like cottage cheese.

Pour the cup of all purpose flour onto a plate of pie tin, Flour your hands well. Spoon a biscuit size lump of wet dough into the flour and sprinkle some flour over the wet dough to coat the outside. Pick up the biscuit and shape it roughly into a soft round. At the same time, shake off the excess flour. The dough is so soft that it will not hold its shape. As you shape each biscuit, place it in the pan. Push the biscuits tightly against each other so that they will rise up and not spread out. Continue shaping biscuits in the this manner until all of the dough is used. To make a large batch of biscuits in a hurry, spray a medium-small (about 2-inch_ ice cream scoop with nonstick coking spray. Cover a jelly-roll pan with all-purpose flour. Quickly scoop biscuits onto the flour, sprinkle with flour, shape and place in small pans.

Bake just above the center  of the oven until lightly browned. 15 to 20 minutes, then brush will melted butter. Cool 1 or 2 minutes in the pan, then dump out and cut the biscuits apart. “Better’em while they’re hot!” Split the biscuits  in half, butter or spread with the Cherry-Chambord butter (recipe follows), and eat immediately.
