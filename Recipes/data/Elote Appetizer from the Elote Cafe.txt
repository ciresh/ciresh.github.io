Elote Appetizer from the Elote Cafe

6 ears corn, husks intact
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon cholula brand hot sauce
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup Cotija cheese, crumbled for garnish
2 teaspoons cilantro, chopped, for garnish
pure ground red chili pepper, for garnish
crispy tortilla chips, for scooping

Over a medium-high grill, roast the corn until the husks are well charred, about 5 minutes. Turn occasionally so as not to burn the side contacting the direct heat.
Set the roasted ears aside until cool enough to handle, then shuck them.

Cut the kernels off the cob.

When ready to eat, mix the mayo, hot sauce, lime juice, pepper, salt and chicken stock in a saut√© pan over medium heat.

Add the corn kernels and warm through,.

Pour into a bowl and garnish with the cheese, cilantro and ground chili.

Serve immediately with crispy tortilla chips.
