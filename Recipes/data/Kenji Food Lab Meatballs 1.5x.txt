Kenji Food Lab Meatballs

1.5 pound ground beef
1.5 pound ground pork
1.5 tablespoon Kosher salt (2.25 teaspoon)
1.5 cup butter milk
3/4 ounce (1 packet) unflavored gelatin
6 slices bread, crusts removed
3 teaspoons soy sauce
3/4 teaspoons Marmite
3 to 4 anchovy fillets, mashed to paste (about 3/4 tablespoon)
3 eggs
4.5 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano
4.5 medium cloves garlic minced or grated (about 1.5 tablespoon)
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Combine beef and pork with 1 tablespoon salt. Mix thoroughly with your hands, that set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour the buttermilk into a large bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Allow to hydrate for 10 minutes. Add the bread and allow to soak for 10 minutes, turning the bread occasionally until completely saturated.

After the meat has rested, add the soy sauce, Marmite, anchovy paste, the eggs, cheese, garlic and the parsley to the bowl. Add the bread and buttermilk mixture and mix gently with your hands until well combined; do no knead excessively. Pull off a teaspoon size piece and microwave until cook thoroughly, about 15 seconds. Taste for seasoning.
