Scrambled Eggs with Bacon, Onion, and Pepper Jack Cheese

Serves 4 to 6.   Published January 1, 2005.

Ingredients:
12 large eggs
3/4 teaspoon table salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 tablespoons half-and-half
4 slices bacon (about 4 ounces), halved lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
1 medium onion , chopped medium (about 1 cup)
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/2 ounces Pepper Jack cheese or Monterey Jack, shredded (about 1/2 cup)
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley leaves (optional)
Instructions


1. Crack eggs into medium bowl; add salt, pepper, and half-and-half. Beat with dinner fork until thoroughly combined.

2. Cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate; discard all but 2 teaspoons bacon fat. Add onion to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer onion to second plate.

3. Thoroughly wipe out skillet with paper towels, add butter, and set over medium heat. When butter foams, swirl to coat bottom and sides of skillet, then pour in eggs. With heatproof rubber spatula, stir eggs constantly, slowly pushing them from side to side, scraping along bottom of skillet and then around sides, and lifting and folding eggs as they form curds. Do not over-scramble, as curds formed will be too small. Cook eggs until large curds form but eggs are still very moist, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, gently fold in onion, cheese, and half of bacon until evenly distributed; if eggs are still underdone, return skillet to medium heat for no longer than 30 seconds. Divide eggs among individual plates, sprinkle with remaining bacon and parsley, and serve immediately.
