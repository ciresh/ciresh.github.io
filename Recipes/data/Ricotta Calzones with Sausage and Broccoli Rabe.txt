Ricotta Calzones with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe

1. Follow recipe for Ricotta Calzones through step 1 to make dough; while dough rises, combine cheeses, egg yolk, oregano, salt, and black pepper in medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until needed. Remove casing from 8 ounces hot or sweet Italian sausage. Wash and dry 12 ounces broccoli rabe and trim stalks to about 1 inch below leaves; cut broccoli rabe crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Cook sausage in -12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, stirring constantly with wooden spoon and breaking sausage into 1/2-inch pieces, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes; stir in 1 tablespoon pressed or minced garlic and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Stir in broccoli rabe, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/8 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring constantly, until broccoli rabe is tender-crisp and water has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to large paper towelâ€“lined plate and cool to room temperature; once cooled, pat with paper towels to absorb excess moisture and set aside until needed.

2. Continue with recipe from step 4. To fill calzones, divide sausage mixture evenly into 6 portions on plate; place 1 portion sausage mixture on top of cheese filling on dough round and continue with recipe to seal and bake calzones.
