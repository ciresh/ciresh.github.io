Macaroni and Cheese
source: Everyday Food

Serves 4; Prep time: 25 minutes; Total time: 30 minutes

Coarse salt and ground pepper

1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes
1 teaspoon olive oil
12 ounces plain or whole-wheat corkscrew pasta (fusilli)
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups low-fat (1%) milk
Pinch of ground nutmeg

8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups), plus more for serving (optional)

1.Preheat oven to 475Â°. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss tomatoes with oil on prepared baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast until lightly browned and soft, 8 to 10 minutes; set aside.

2. Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente, according to package instructions. Drain; set aside.

3. While pasta is cooking, melt butter over low heat in a large saucepan. Add flour; cook, whisking, 1 minute. Gradually, whisk in milk, then nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt, and a pinch of pepper; bring to a simmer. Cook, whisking constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted.

4. Add cooked pasta to cheese mixture; stir to combine. (Sauce will thicken as it stands.) Serve topped with tomatoes and, if desired, additional grated cheddar.
