Smoked Salmon - Light on sugar and salt

3-5 lb. salmon fillet
4 cups water
1/4 cup Diamond Kosher Salt (or 2 tablespoons table salt)
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons granulated onion
2 teaspoons granulated garlic 
2 teaspoons black pepper

Mix and brine salmon for 90 minutes. Remove and let dry. Optional: Let sit in refrigerator for 2+ hours and the surface will get tacky and absorb more smoke.

1 tablespoon Diamond Kosher Salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt (or less)
1 teaspoons Brown Sugar (or more)
1 teaspoons granulated garlic
1 teaspoons granulated onion
1 teaspoons dried dill

Combine and spread on salmon. Place the salmon on a folded piece of aluminum foil and smoke with apple, cherry or hickory wood at 225-275F for 50-70 minutes or until the internal temperature hits 125F
