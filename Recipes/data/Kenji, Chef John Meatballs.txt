1/2 cup plain bread crumbs

2 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
3 eggs

1/3 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
4 cloves garlic, crushed
3 teaspoons salt
1.5 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1.5 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese


1.5 pound ground beef
1.5 pound ground pork
1.5 tablespoon Kosher salt (2.25 teaspoon)
1.5 cup butter milk
3/4 ounce (1 packet) unflavored gelatin
6 slices bread, crusts removed
3 teaspoons soy sauce
3/4 teaspoons Marmite
3 to 4 anchovy fillets, mashed to paste (about 3/4 tablespoon)

Kenji:

Combine beef and pork with 1 tablespoon salt. Mix thoroughly with your hands, that set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour the buttermilk into a large bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Allow to hydrate for 10 minutes. Add the bread and allow to soak for 10 minutes, turning the bread occasionally until completely saturated.

After the meat has rested, add the soy sauce, Marmite, anchovy paste, the eggs, cheese, garlic and the parsley to the bowl. Add the bread and buttermilk mixture and mix gently with your hands until well combined; do no knead excessively. Pull off a teaspoon size piece and microwave until cook thoroughly, about 15 seconds. Taste for seasoning.

Chef John:

Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.

Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until translucent, about 20 minutes.

Mix beef and pork together in a large bowl. Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes,

Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange onto prepared baking sheet.

Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
