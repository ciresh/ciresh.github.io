Dark Chocolate Mouse

10 grams (1T + 1/4t) Gelatin Powder
14 grams 1T cold water
245 grams 1 cup whole milk
305 grams 11 ounces dark chocolate, chopped
450 grams 1 3/4 cups + 2T cold heavy cream

1. Dissolve the gelatin: Combine the gelatin and cold water in a small bowl and stir with
a spoon until the gelatin has dissolved.

2. Make the hot milk mixture: Put the milk in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil
over medium heat. Remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin mixture.

3. Make the ganache: Place the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Without stirring,
slowly pour the hot milk mixture over the chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds, then whisk
until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth.

4. Whip the cream: In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl
using a whisk or hand mixer), whip the cream on medium speed until it holds soft peaks,
about 5 minutes. Make sure the cream is coldâ€”room-temperature cream won't whip up as easily.

5. Finish the mousse: While the ganache is still warm, slowly pour it into the whipped
cream a little at a time, gently folding it with a spatula until just combined. If you're
making a mousse cake, use the mousse immediately. If you're making a layer
cake, refrigerate the mousse covered with plastic wrap pressed directly against the
surface, until spreadable, about 5 minutes.

Pour mousse into small cups or ramekins, chill it for at least 45 minutes to an hour, then top it with whipped cream for an easy dessert.
