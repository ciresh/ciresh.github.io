Menastra

2 small or one large escarole
1-2 large Potato(s)
1 can of Cannelli Beans
2 inches of pepperoni cut up in small pieces
2 Slices italian bread
1-3 cloves garlic, crushed or finely chopped
2-3 tablespoons olive oil

Wash escarole good (it can be very sanding). Cook escarole and potato in boiling water until tender (the potato will take less time). Drain.

In skillet, add oil, pepperoni and garlic. When garlic begin to turn light brown, add escarole, potatoes and cannelli. Tear up bread and add to pan. Let it cook, stirring often so it won't stick to pad. It is done when the beans have broken down and have become fully incorporated.
