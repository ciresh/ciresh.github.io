Creamed Spinach (Cooks Country)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 shallot, minced
1 garlic clove, minced
1 pound (16 cups) baby spinach
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1 cup)
1/2 teaspoon pepper
Pinch ground nutmeg

Baby spinach comes in a wide range of package sizes; this recipe works with anywhere from 15 to 18 ounces of baby spinach. You can substitute half-and-half for the heavy cream, if desired, but the resulting dish will be less rich and slightly more soupy. Preheat your serving dish in a 200-degree oven for 10 minutes so that the spinach stays warm on the table.

Using fork, mash 2 tablespoons softened butter and flour together in bowl to form smooth paste; set aside. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and cook until shallot is translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spinach and salt and turn with tongs to coat with butter, shallot, and garlic. Cook until just wilted, about 4 minutes.

Add cream and bring to simmer. Stir in flour mixture until incorporated. Cook until cream thickens and clings to spinach, about 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in Parmesan, pepper, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to warm shallow dish and serve.
