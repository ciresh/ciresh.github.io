Cinnamon & Cardamom Brioche Buns

Double (double recipe)
500g (1.1lb) strong white bread flour, chilled
45g (1.6oz) water, chilled
250g (8.8oz) eggs, chilled
13g (0.45oz) salt
60g (2.1oz) sugar
8g (0.28oz) instant dry yeast or 9.6g (0.33oz) active dry yeast or 24g (0.84oz) fresh yeast
200g (7oz) cold butter that has been pressed between baking paper to make it soft
 

For the filling –
70g (2.45oz) softened butter
70g (2.45oz) sugar
5g (0.17oz) cinnamon
3g (0.1oz) cardamom
*Mix all together until smooth
 
To top –
1 egg for glazing
50g (1.75oz) crushed pistachios


For the sugar syrup –
30g (1oz) water
40g (1.4oz) sugar

*Bring up to a boil before the buns come out the oven


In a mixing bowl combine the water, salt, yeast, sugar, eggs, and flour. Switch the mixer on 2nd (slow) speed. Mix for 10 minutes. After the first 10 minutes start adding the butter in chunks. Mix for another 5 minutes scraping the sides of the bowl down if need be. Once the butter has mixed into the dough turn the speed up to medium which on my mixer is the 4th Mix for around 7 minutes or until the dough stops sticking to the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Turn the speed back down to the 2nd (slow) setting. Keep mixing for another 3 minutes. The total mixing time should not exceed 25 minutes. *Desired dough temperature 25 – 26C (77-79F).

Shape the dough into a ball, place it into a bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Fold. Refrigerate for 1 more hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape into balls. Wrap them in clingfilm and cold proof for up to 24 hours. One dough ball will make 5 large buns. If you want to use the whole dough to make 10 burgers, then keep it whole and give it one last fold instead of dividing it. And double the ingredients for the fillings.
Make the brioche dough and leave to cold ferment overnight.

Roll the dough out and spread the filling all over it evenly.

Fold the dough in 3 layers. Roll it out slightly. Cut into 6 strips. Twist each strip into a ball and place on a non-stick paper lined tray.
Final proof for 4 hours. *During the final hour of fermentation preheat the oven to 160C (320F) fan on.

Brush the buns with egg and top with pistachios.

Bake for 25 minutes.

Brush with the hot sugar syrup as soon as they come out the oven.
