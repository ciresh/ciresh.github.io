Miso Butter Glazed Carrots Recipe

2 pounds carrots
1 medium scallion
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
2 tablespoons white miso paste, divided
2 tablespoons honey, divided
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
3 tablespoons water
1 clove garlic
Toasted white sesame seeds, for garnish

Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 425Â°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Peel and trim 2 pounds carrots. If they are more than 1-inch thick, cut them in half lengthwise; otherwise, leave them whole. Cut the carrots crosswise on a slight diagonal into 2-inch-long pieces and place on the baking sheet. Thinly slice 1 medium scallion and reserve for garnish.

Place 3 tablespoons of the unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon of the white miso paste, 1 tablespoon of the honey, and 1 tablespoon rice vinegar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the butter is melted and the mixture is combined and slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.

Drizzle over the carrots (reserve the saucepan) and toss to coat with your hands. Arrange the carrots into a single layer, cut-side down.
Roast for 15 minutes. Flip the carrots and roast until tender and the edges are charred and crispy, about 15 minutes more.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 tablespoon white miso paste, 1 tablespoon honey, and 3 tablespoons water in the reserved saucepan (no need to wash). Place over medium-low heat. Finely grate 1 peeled garlic clove directly into the saucepan. Whisk until the mixture is combined and starting to bubbling.

Turn off the heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon unsalted butter and whisk until melted and the glaze is slightly thickened.

When the carrots are ready, transfer them to a serving bowl. Drizzle the miso-butter glaze over the carrots. Garnish with the reserved scallions and toasted white sesame seeds.
