Port Wine-Blue Cheese Ball

Source: Cooks Country 11/07

1 cup crumbled blue cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon port wine
1 garlic glove, minced
1/2 cup pecans, toasted and chopped fine

Process all of the ingredients (except the nuts, chives or tortilla chips) in food processor until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary, about 1 minute. Transfer the cheese mixture to the center of a large sheet of plastic wrap.

Holding the corners of the wrap in one hand, twist the cheese with your other hand to seal the wrap and shape the cheese into a round ball (mixture will be somewhat loose). Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours (the cheese can be refrigerated for up to 2 days). Once the cheese ball is firm, reshape it as necessary into a smooth sphere. Unwrap the cheese ball and roll it in nuts, chives or tortilla chips. Let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.
