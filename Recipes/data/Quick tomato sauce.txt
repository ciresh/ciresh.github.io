Quick tomato sauce

MAKES 3 CUPS, ENOUGH FOR 1 POUND OF PASTA

Our preferred brands of crushed tomatoes are Tuttorosso and Muir Glen (Hunt's Organic, Redpack and Progresso). Grate the onion on the large holes of a box grater.

INGREDIENTS

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup grated onion
1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or 1/4 teaspoon dried
Salt and pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
INSTRUCTIONS
Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and sugar, bring to simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in basil and oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.
