4 (4 ounce) patties ground beef
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 cups beef stock
8 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons cornstarch
4 teaspoons ketchup
5 teaspoons white sugar (Optional)
4 drops sesame oil, or to taste
4 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided
4 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only
4 eggs
4 cups hot cooked white rice


Whisk together beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cornstarch, ketchup, sugar, and sesame oil in a bowl; set aside.

Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Flip patties; add green onions and cook until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove patties and most of green onions to a plate.

Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.

Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.

Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over rice, spoon gravy on top, and add fried eggs.
