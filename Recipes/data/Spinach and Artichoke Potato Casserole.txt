Spinach and Artichoke Potato Casserole

3   large russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs./680 g)
4 oz. (125 g) cream cheese, softened
1 oz. (30 g) Parmesan cheese, finely grated (1/2 cup/125 mL)
2 cups (500 mL) fresh spinach, chopped (see cook's tip)
1 can (14 oz./398 mL) quartered artichoke hearts, drained
1 tbsp (15 mL) Garlic Parmesan Seasoning
1/4 cup (60 mL) sour cream or Greek yogurt
1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt
8 oz. (250 g) white cheddar, grated (2 cups/500 mL), divided

Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).

Pierce the potatoes with a fork. Microwave the potatoes for 10–12 minutes, or until very tender. Remove them from the microwave, let cool, and roughly chop.

Add the potatoes to the Deluxe Stand Mixer with the remaining ingredients and half of the cheddar. Set to MIX for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

Spoon the mashed potato mixture into the 8" (20-cm) Brilliance Nonstick Square Pan. Top the potatoes with the remaining cheddar and bake for 10–15 minutes, 
or until they’re golden brown and bubbly.

You can use a thawed 12-oz. (350-g) bag of frozen spinach instead of fresh.
