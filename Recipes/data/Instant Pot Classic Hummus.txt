Instant Pot Classic Hummus

For Cooking the Beans
1/2 pound dry garbanzo beans
3 1/2 cups water (for cooking beans)
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic/ garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

For the Hummus
drained, cooked garbanzo beans
3/4 cup reserved cooking liquid (I started with 1/2 cup and added until the consistency looked good to me)
1/3 cup tahini
zest of 1/2 lemon
juice of one whole lemon
2 Tablespoons olive oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1 clove fresh garlic, roughly chopped
Optional: olive oil, paprika and oregano - for garnish

Cooking the Beans
Add the water, dry beans, garlic powder and salt to the Instant Pot.

Close the lid, lock it and cook on manual high pressure for 60 minutes with a full natural pressure release (NPR - do not use quick release lever, but allow the pressure indicator pin to drop on its own).

Drain the beans, and reserve the cooking liquid to use in the hummus, and allow them to cool for a few minutes. It's okay if they are still a little warm, but you don't want them piping hot.

Making the Hummus
Add the cooked beans, half cup of cooking liquid (for starting out), tahini, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and cumin to the food processor, and blend.

Stop the food processor, and check the taste and consistency. Add more cooking liquid, if desired. I used a total of 3/4 cup of cooking liquid, FYI. 

Serve and enjoy! Refrigerate leftovers for up to a week.
