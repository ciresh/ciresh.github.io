Lemon bread - Reddit

1 cup (198 g) sugar
1/2 cup (99 g) vegetable oil or 1/2 cup (128 g) unsweetened applesauce
3 tbsp lemon zest
1/4 cup (57 g) lemon juice
3/4 cup (170 g) buttermilk
2 large eggs
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tbsp poppy seeds (optional)
2 1/2 cups (300 g) all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 350Â°F and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, oil, lemon zest and juice, beating until thoroughly combined. In a separate small bowl, beat the buttermilk and eggs. Combine the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl and whisk together to mix evenly. Add the dry ingredients to the sugar and oil alternately with the buttermilk mixture, scraping the bowl at least once. When everything is incorporated, pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 50-60 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven and place it on a rack.

Lemon glaze

1/4 cup (57 g) lemon juice
1/3 cup (66 g) sugar

Combine the lemon juice and sugar in a microwave-safe container and microwave on high for 30 seconds to dissolve the sugar. Poke holes in the bread before soaking it with the glaze.
