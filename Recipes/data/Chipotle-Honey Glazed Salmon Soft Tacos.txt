Chipotle-Honey Glazed Salmon Soft Tacos with Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa

Serves 4 (two tacos per person)

4 4-oz skinless salmon filets
Salt and pepper
4 chipotle chiles from a can, finely chopped and mixed with 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from same can
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

1 large, ripe avocado, coarsely chopped
1 7.5-ounce can tomatillo salsa (Salsa Verde), such as Herdez
1-2 large jalapeno chiles, minced
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (packed)
Juice of 1 lime

2 cups cooked black beans
8 ounces crumbled queso fresco

8 warm taco-sized flour tortillas

Lime wedges for serving

Season salmon filets with salt and pepper. Combine chipotle chile with sauce, honey and lime juice in a bowl. Brush the marinade over both sides of the salmon and let stand at room temperature for fifteen minutes.

Meanwhile, combine tomatillo sauce and avocado in a processor. Process to smooth puree. Add jalapeno chiles, cilantro and lime juice. Process until smooth and season with salt to taste.

Light a grill or broiler and cook the salmon until done, turning once and basting with any extra chipotle marinade, about 4 minutes per side.

Place one salmon filet and 1/2-cup black beans on each plate. Let guests assemble tacos like this: In each warm tortilla spread about 1/4-cup black beans and half of each filet, forked into chunks. Top with dollops of avocado salsa and sprinkle with queso fresco. Squeeze lime over, fold tacos and enjoy.
