Sourdough Bread (Chain Baker)

For the levain:

20g (0.7oz) sourdough starter
40g (1.4oz) strong white bread flour
40g (1.4oz) room temperature water

For the main dough:
400g (14.1oz) strong white bread flour
50g (1.75oz) wholemeal flour
10g (0.35oz) salt
100g (3.5oz) of levain
265g (9.3oz) water at around 20 – 22C (68-71F) if your kitchen is 20 – 22C (68-71F), if it is warmer then lower water temperature by 1 – 2C (2-3F) and vice versa.

Make the levain by mixing all ingredients and leaving out for 12 – 16h.
In a bowl add the water, levain and salt and mix well.
Add the flour and mix until no more dry flour left.
Knead the dough for around 5 – 7 minutes until decent gluten development.

Fold.
Place in the fridge for 12-16 hours to cold ferment.

Score the dough and bake for 20 minutes with the lid on.
Remove lid and bake for a further 20 minutes.
