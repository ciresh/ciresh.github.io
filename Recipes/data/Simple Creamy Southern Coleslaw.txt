Simple Creamy Southern Coleslaw

Slaw

1 pound green cabbage (about half a medium cabbage)
1 large carrot, peeled
1/2 small white onion
2 tablespoons Morton Coarse Kosher Salt

Dressing

1 tablespoon distilled vinegar
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery seeds (not celery salt)

First, read my article on The Science of Slawsome Slaw. Then decide how you want to cut the cabbage, carrot, and onion: Chopped, grated, or hashed and have at it. I prefer this recipe shredded or chopped.

In a large strainer or colander, mix the cabbage, carrot, and onion with the salt and put it in the sink or over a bowl for an hour. The salt will draw out a lot of water that will otherwise dilute the dressing. Then rinse the mix with cold water to get rid of excess salt and pat dry. You can now hold it in the fridge for a day if you want.

Whisk together the dressing in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot, and onion mix. Taste, adjust seasonings, cover and chill for at least 1 hour if possible before serving.
