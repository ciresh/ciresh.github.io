From Cooking Light

3/4  cup rice vinegar
1/4  cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4  cup low-sodium soy sauce
3  tablespoons water
1  tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
2  tablespoons chunky peanut butter
1/2  to 3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
4  garlic cloves, minced
Cooking spray
1/2  pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2  cup (2 ounces) shredded reduced-fat, reduced-sodium Swiss cheese (such as Alpine Lace)
1/4  cup (1 ounce) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1  (12-inch) Basic Pizza Crust
1/4  cup chopped green onions

Preheat oven to 500°.

Combine first 8 ingredients in a bowl; stir well with a whisk.

Heat a nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add chicken, and sauté 2 minutes. Remove chicken from pan.

Pour rice vinegar mixture into pan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook mixture 6 minutes or until slightly thickened. Return chicken to pan; cook 1 minute or until chicken is done. (Mixture will be consistency of thick syrup.)

Sprinkle cheeses over prepared crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border, and top with chicken mixture. Bake at 500° for 12 minutes on bottom rack in oven. Sprinkle with green onions. Place pizza on a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes.
