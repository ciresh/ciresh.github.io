Instant Pot Turkey Stock

1 roasted or pressure cooked turkey carcass cut into 6 to 8 pieces OR 2 roasted hindquarters*
1 large onion coarsely chopped
2 large carrots roughly chopped
2 celery stalks roughly chopped
3 garlic cloves smashed
1 bay leaf
5 sprigs fresh parsley
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorns
10 cups water

Put all of the ingredients in the pressure cooking pot. Select High Pressure and a 30-90 minute cook time.

When the cook time ends, turn the pressure cooker off and use a natural pressure release. When the valve drops, carefully remove the lid.

Allow the stock to cool slightly. Pour the stock through a fine-mesh strainer set over a very large bowl or pot. Discard the solids.

Cover the bowl and refrigerate. When chilled, skim fat from the surface.
