Official Cardogs BBQ Salmon

Dry Rub

1 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 cup non-iodized table salt
3 Tablespoons granulated garlic powder
3 Tablespoons granulated onion
1 Tablespoon dried dill weed
1 Tablespoon dried savory
2 teaspoons dried tarragon

Mix all ingredients thoroughly. Turbinado sugar may be substituted for brown sugar. To substitute garlic salt and onion salt, reduce table salt to 1/2 cup and double garlic salt and onion salt to 6 Tablespoons.

Finishing Rub

1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 Tablespoon granulated garlic powder
1 Tablespoon granulated onion
1 teaspoon dried savory
1 teaspoon dried tarragon

Mix all ingredients thoroughly. Turbinado sugar may be substituted for brown sugar.

Buy a fresh, 3-pound salmon fillet, preferably Sockeye or King. Remove the pin bones using tweezers or needle-nosed pliers. Do not remove the skin. Place skin-side down in a glass or stainless steel pan.

Pack the dry rub on the flesh side of the fillet, approximately 1/4″ thick. Let the fillet rest in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours (the longer you leave the rub on, the stronger the salt flavor). Rinse the fillet in cool, clean water to remove the dry rub, then pat dry. Allow to dry for about 30 minutes, until the flesh becomes tacky.

Heat a barbecue grill to medium to medium-high. Sprinkle finishing rub on the fillet (twice what you would use as if you were heavy salt and peppering). Cook with the lid closed to an internal temp of 140-155°F (your preference) measured in the center of the thickest part of the fillet.
