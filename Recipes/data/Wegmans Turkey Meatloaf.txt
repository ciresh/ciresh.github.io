Wegmans Turkey Meatloaf

2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 large onion. Grated or chopped fine in food processor
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1  tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons ketchup
3 pounds ground turkey
3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs
2 eggs

Mix all ingredients. Bake at 375 for 1 hour, 45 minutes.

Note: Instead of grating, try dicing and then cooking in butter. 

Glaze (optional)

1/2	cup ketchup
1	teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/2	teaspoon ground coriander
1/4	cup cider vinegar
3	tablespoons packed light brown sugar



While meatloaf cooks, combine ingredients for glaze in small saucepan; bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring, until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Spread half of glaze evenly over cooked meatloaf with rubber spatula; place under broiler and cook until glaze bubbles and begins to brown at edges, about 5 minutes. Remove meatloaf from oven and spread evenly with remaining glaze; place back under broiler and cook until glaze is again bubbling and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes more. Let meatloaf cool about 20 minutes before slicing.
