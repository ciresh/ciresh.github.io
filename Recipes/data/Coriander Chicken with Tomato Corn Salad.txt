Coriander Chicken with Tomato Corn Salad
From Cooking Light

Assemble all the ingredients, then start cooking the chicken. As the chicken sizzles, make the salad.

Chicken:
1  tablespoon  olive oil
1 1/2  teaspoons  ground coriander
1/2  teaspoon  salt
1/2  teaspoon  ground cumin
1/4  teaspoon  chili powder
1/8  teaspoon  ground cinnamon
1/8  teaspoon  black pepper
4  (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Salad:
2  cups  cherry tomatoes, halved
1/4  cup  sliced green onion tops
2  tablespoons  thinly sliced fresh basil
1  tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
1  teaspoon  olive oil
1/4  teaspoon  salt
1/8  teaspoon  black pepper
1  (7-ounce) can whole-kernel corn, drained

To prepare the chicken, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Combine coriander and the next 5 ingredients (coriander through 1/8 teaspoon black pepper); rub evenly over both sides of chicken. Add chicken to pan; cook 5 minutes on each side or until done.

To prepare salad, combine tomatoes and remaining ingredients, tossing well. Slice chicken; serve over salad.


Yield: 4 servings (serving size: about 4 1/2 ounces chicken and 3/4 cup salad)
