Almond Paste (KAF)

1 3/4 cups (168g) King Arthur Almond Flour
1 1/2 cups (170g) confectioners' sugar
1 (30g) large egg white
1/8 teaspoon table salt
1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract, to taste

Combine the almond flour and confectioners' sugar in the work bowl of a food processor or in the bowl of a stand mixer. Process or mix to blend briefly, just to combine.

Add the egg white, salt, and almond extract, processing or mixing until the mixture comes together and forms a malleable ball.

Remove the almond paste from the processor or mixer, scraping any residue from the sides of the bowl.

Shape the paste into a log or round. Double wrap it in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.
