No-Knead Country Bread - King Arthur

1 1/2 cups (340g) water
2 cups (241g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 1/4 cups (142g) King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup (21g) whole flax meal
1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) salt
1 teaspoon instant yeast

Stir together all of the ingredients (or use a stand mixer) to make a sticky dough. Continue to work the dough enough to incorporate all the flour, or beat for several minutes in a stand mixer.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature overnight, or for at least 8 hours; it'll become bubbly and rise quite a bit, so be sure your bowl is large enough.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. To make a single loaf, choose a 14" to 15" long lidded stoneware baker; a 9" x 12" oval deep casserole dish with cover; or a 9" to 10" round, 4" deep lidded baking crock. To make 2 loaves, lightly grease (or line with parchment) a large baking sheet.

Shape the dough to fit, and place it in the lightly greased pan of your choice, smooth side up. For two loaves, divide dough in half, shape each into an oval loaf, and place on the prepared baking sheet.

Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, until dough has become puffy and fills the pan about 1/2 full.

Slash the loaf in a cross-hatch pattern or 3 diagonal slashes just before placing into the oven.

If baking in a lidded crock or pan, place into a cold oven. Set the oven temperature to 450°F.

Bake the bread for 45 to 50 minutes, then remove the lid and continue to bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, until the bread is deep brown, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers about 205°F.

To bake on a baking sheet, preheat the oven to 400°F, and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, until bread is deep brown. Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out onto a rack, and cool before slicing.
