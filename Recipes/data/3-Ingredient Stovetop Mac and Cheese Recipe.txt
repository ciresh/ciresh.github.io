3-Ingredient Stovetop Mac and Cheese Recipe

12 ounces (340 g) elbow macaroni
Salt
12 ounces (360 ml) evaporated milk
12 ounces (340 g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruyère, or Jack
Directions

Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.
