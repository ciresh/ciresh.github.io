Chain Baker Sourdough Starter

50g (1.75oz) strong white bread flour
50g (1.75oz) room temperature filtered water

Day#1 – Mix the flour and water, cover and leave out for 24 hours.

Day#2 – Remove 50g (1.75oz) of the mix and replace with 25g (0.88oz) flour and 25g (0.88oz) water. Mix, cover and leave out for 24h.

Day#3 – Repeat what you did on Day#2.

Day#4, #5, #6, #7 etc. repeat until you start seeing activity.

Once active feed it at a 1:10:10 ratio daily to make it stronger.

To build the levain for baking, take 1 part of starter and add 2 parts water, 2 parts flour.

Example for 1 normal bread loaf with 500g (17.6oz) flour I normally use 100g (3.5oz) levain. To make it, take 20g (0.7oz) starter and add 40g (1.4oz) water and 40g (1.4oz) flour for a 1:2:2 ratio.

Once your starter is nice and strong you can keep it in the fridge and feed it before baking. Take it out, discard or use any excess starter, once again feed it at a 1:10:10 ratio and when it is ready, use part of it to build the levain for baking. And place the leftover starter back in the fridge until next time. It is best to refrigerate your starter when it is puffed up and active. That way it will be more lively when you pull it out next time when you are ready to bake.
