Grilled Fish Tacos

1/2 small head green cabbage (about 8 ounces), cored and shredded (about 4 cups)
1/4 cup cilantro
3 scallions, sliced thin
1 teaspoon canola oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cider vinegar

1 tablespoon cilantro
3/4  cup light mayonnaise
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 teaspoons minced canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce (I use 1/4 chipotle powder)
1 garlic glove, minced.

1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper 
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/4 teaspoon cumin

4 (6-ounce) skinless mahi-mahi fillets, about 1 inch thick.
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, warmed

Brush fish with 2 teaspoons oil, then rube evenly with the spice mixture. Cook until the fillets are opaque about 10 to 14 minutes, flipping once.
