Baked Macaroni and Cheese
SERVES 6 TO 8
Although the classic pasta shape for this dish is elbow macaroni, any small, curvaceous pasta will work.

1 recipe (about 2 3/4 cups) Toasted Bread Crumb Topping (page 242) 
Salt 
1 pound elbow macaroni
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
1 medium garlic clove, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour 
2 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 1/2 cups whole milk
1 pound colby cheese, shredded (about4 cups) 
8 ounces extra-sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)
Ground black pepper
1. Make the topping and set aside. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Stir in 1 tablespoon salt and the macaroni and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Drain the pasta and leave it in the colander; set aside.

2. Wipe the pot dry, add the butter, and set it over medium heat until melted. Stir in the garlic, mustard, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring con stantly, until golden, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking often, until large bubbles form on the surface and the mixture is slightly thick ened, about 15 minutes. Off the heat, gradually whisk in the colby and cheddar until completely melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Stir the drained pasta into the cheese sauce, breaking up any clumps, until well combined. Pour into a 13 by 9-inch baking dish and sprinkle with the crumb topping.

4. TO STORE: Wrap the dish tightly with plastic wrap and then foil and refrigerate for up to 2 days
