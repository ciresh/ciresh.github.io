Easy, Creamy One-Pot Salmon Chowder Recipe

1/2 pound salt pork or bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (225g)
2 tablespoons water (30ml)
1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)
2 large ribs celery, finely chopped (about 6 ounces; 170g)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (about 20g)
1 cup bottled clam juice (235ml)
1 quart whole milk (900ml)
1 pound russet or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (450g)
1 bay leaf
3/4 to 1 pound boneless, skinless fish scraps, such as salmon, cod, or halibut, cut into 3/4-inch chunks (350-450g)
Minced fresh herbs such as parsley, dill, or chives, for serving
Hot sauce, for serving
Crackers, for serving

Combine salt pork or bacon and water in a heavy-bottomed stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated and pork has begun to brown and crisp in spots, about 8 minutes. Add onion, and celery. Season gently with salt and pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes longer. Add flour and cook, stirring, until no pockets of raw flour remain. Stir in clam juice, followed by milk. Add potatoes and bay leaf and bring to a simmer.

Simmer chowder, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are fully tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in fish chunks and simmer just until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Serve immediately, garnished with minced fresh herbs, hot sauce, and crackers.
