Crunchy Corn Meal Waffles

1 3/4 cups buttermilk
2 large eggs
5 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled OR 3/8 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons minced fresh chives (or 3 tablespoons dried chives); optional
2 to 3 teaspoons ground cumin (optional)
1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, or 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (optional)

To make the waffles: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter or oil.

In a separate bowl, blend together the dry ingredients, then quickly and gently combine the wet and dry ingredients.

Let the batter sit for 10 minutes, to allow the cornmeal to soften.

Drop the batter by 1/3-cupfuls onto a hot waffle iron, and cook it until steam stops seeping from the iron.

To make the chili con queso: Heat together, over low heat, the salsa, cream cheese, and grated cheese, cooking and stirring until the mixture is smooth.

Stir in the chopped spinach and scallions.

KAF Yeast Waffles

1 1/2 cups lukewarm milk
6 tablespoons butter, melted
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, leaving room for expansion; the mixture will bubble and grow.

Stir to combine; it's OK if the mixture isn't perfectly smooth.

Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour; the mixture will begin to bubble. You can cook the waffles at this point, or refrigerate the batter overnight to cook waffles the next day.
