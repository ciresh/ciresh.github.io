Instant Pot Corned Beef and Cabbage

4-5 garlic cloves
4 cups water
2.5-3 lb. corned beef brisket, including spice packet or DIY spice packet
2 lbs petite red potatoes, quartered
3 cups baby carrots
1 head green cabbage, cut into large wedges

DIRECTIONS:

1. Place corned beef brisket, spice packet, garlic and 4 cups of water into the instant pot. I used the rack to keep the brisket off the bottom of the pot.

2. Cook on high pressure for 60 minutes, natural release for 15 minutes. Remove corned beef to a platter and cover with foil. Let rest while cooking the vegetables.

3. Without discarding liquid, add potatoes, carrots, and cabbage to pressure cooker, you may remove the rack if desired.

4. Cook at high pressure for 3-4 minutes. Do a quick pressure release before removing vegetables.
