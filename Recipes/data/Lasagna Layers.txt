Eric's Lasagna Recipe

2-24 ounces spaghetti sauce
15 ounces ricotta cheese
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (11 oz)
2 large eggs
1.5 oz grated Romano cheese
13 lasagna noodles
4 Slice Provlone

Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF.

To assemble, spray a 9x13 baking pan with cooking spray.
Spread 3/4 cup of sauce on the bottom of the baking pan.
Cover the bottom with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles.
Top with 1/2 of the cheese mixture and 1/4 of the sauce.
Repeat layers (noodles, cheese, sauce, noodles, cheese, sauce).
Top with 3 noodles, remaining sauce, remaining 1 cup of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

Spray a sheet of aluminium foil with cooking spray. Cover with the pan with aluminum foil (sprayed side down). This spray prevents the cheese from sticking.

Bake for 50 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes.

Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
