Smoked Salmon - light on sugar and salt

2 lb salmon fillet
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of water
scant 4 tablespoons DC (or a scant 3 of Morton or a scant 2 of table salt)
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons granulated onion
1 tablespoon savory (if you don't have it use thyme)
2 teaspoons ground celery seed (not celery salt)
2 teaspoons granulated garlic 
2 teaspoons black pepper. 

Bring to a boil then simmer 10 min, dissolving the salt and sugar. Remove to a bowl and add 3 cups cold water (ice the water first to speed cooling). Cool the mix to fridge temps. Add the salmon and brine 90 min or so. Rinse briefly, pat dry with paper towel, then air dry on a rack over a pan. It will get tacky when the pellicle forms.


For the rub: Start with Kosher (very little since the salmon was brined) the followed with Turbinado, savory, dill, garlic, onion, and celery. Everything is applied separately, one at a time, VERY lightly, especially the salt which should be very, very light. The others follow, lightly. You should be apple to see the salmon flesh when done. Press lightly into the flesh. 


I Minion with a small amount of lit, maybe 8-10 tops. Have small pieces of wood - I used apple, in there before adding the lit, strewn about. Add the lit, assemble the cooker, then immediately load in the salmon. Smoke, letting the temps rise as they may for a bit, choking the vents when necessary. I just let it rise then choke and let the temps drift down. You can also just choke earlier and stabilize if you prefer. Doesn't really matter. Smoke till just cooked through but still moist (my preference), or longer if you prefer.

EJS: Use 4cu water, and 1/4 cup of DC salt. Skip celery and savory. For finishing rub, 1t DC salt, 1t Brown Sugar, 1t garlic, 1t onion, 1t dill.
