Sour Cream-Chocolate Chip Scones

2 c. all-purpose flour
1/4 c. granulated sugar
1 tbsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
6 tbsp. cold unsalted butter
1 1/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 c. sour cream
1 large egg
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract

Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter and, using a pastry blender or two knives, cut it in until the mixture forms small crumbs. Add the chocolate chips and toss to combine. Make a well in the center of the mixture.

In a bowl, whisk together the sour cream, egg, and vanilla. Add to the flour mixture and, using a fork, gently stir until incorporated (do not overmix). Bring the dough together into a ball.

On a lightly floured surface, shape the dough into an 8-inch round (about 1 inch thick). Cut into 8 wedges, separate, and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
