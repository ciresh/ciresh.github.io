Charcoal-Grilled Bratwurst with Sauerkraut And Apples

SERVES 4
Serve bratwurst as is or in toasted buns.

INGREDIENTS
3 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled and coarsely shredded
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh sage leaves
2 cups sauerkraut, drained
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
13- by 9-inch disposable aluminum roasting pan
2 pounds bratwurst (8 to 12 links) 

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 quarts, or about 100 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Build single-level fire by arranging coals evenly across bottom of grill. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat until grate is hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush.

2. Meanwhile, combine apples, sauerkraut, sage, salt, and pepper in disposable roasting pan. Place bratwurst in single layer over apples and wrap roasting pan tightly with foil.

3. Place roasting pan in center of grill, cover grill, and cook 15 minutes. Move pan to one side of grill and carefully remove foil cover. Using tongs, place bratwurst on grate directly over coals. Grill bratwurst, uncovered, turning every 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bratwurst to platter and loosely tent with foil. Cover grill and continue cooking apples, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates and apples begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Serve bratwurst, passing apples and sauerkraut separately.
