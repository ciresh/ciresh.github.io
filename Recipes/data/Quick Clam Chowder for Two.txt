Serves 2.   Published April 12, 2007.

Use the additional amount of cream if you prefer a thicker clam chowder.
Ingredients
2 (6.5-ounce) cans minced clams
1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice
Water , if necessary
2 slices thick-cut bacon (about 2 ounces), cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1/2 onion , chopped fine
1 clove minced garlic
1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour
2 large red potatoes (about 3/4 pound), scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 - 3/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves
Table salt and ground black pepper
Instructions


1. Drain the clams, reserving the juices. Add the bottled clam juice to the reserved clam juice to measure 2 1/2 cups (if short, add enough water to make up the difference).

2. Cook the bacon in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion and cook until the onion has softened and the bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes.

3. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour and coat the vegetables, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the clam broth. Stir in the potatoes, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.

4. Stir in the clams, cream, and parsley. Return to a simmer briefly, then remove from the heat. Discard the bay leaf, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
