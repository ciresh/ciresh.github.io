Quick and Easy French Toast Casserole - Rachael Ray

Enough Bread to fill an 8x8 baking dish
3 eggs 
1 cups milk 
1/4 cup half and half or cream 
1/3 cups sugar 
1 tablespoons vanilla 
1/4 cup flour 
1/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed 
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1/2 stick butter, cubed 

Spray a 8-inch x x8 - inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.

Tear the bread into chunks and place them in the greased pan. Mix together the eggs, milk, half and half or cream, sugar, and vanilla and pour the mixture evenly over the bread. In another bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Add the butter and mix until the batter comes somewhat together. Sprinkle the flour/sugar mixture evenly over the top of the bread mixture. Bake for 45-60 minutes, until golden brown. Store any leftovers in fridge, tightly covered.
