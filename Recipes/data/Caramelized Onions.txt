INGREDIENTSPrint Shopping List

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
½ teaspoon table salt
1 teaspoon light brown sugar
2 pounds large onions, root end cut off, halved pole to pole, peeled, and sliced ¼ inch thick across the grain
1 tablespoon water
Ground black pepper


Heat butter and oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat; when foam subsides, stir in salt and sugar. Add onions and stir to coat; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to soften and release some moisture, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are deeply browned and slightly sticky, about 40 minutes longer. (If onions are sizzling or scorching, reduce heat. If onions are not browning after 15 to 20 minutes, raise heat.) Off heat, stir in water; season to taste with pepper. (Can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 7 days.)
