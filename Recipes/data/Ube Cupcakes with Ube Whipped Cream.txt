Makes 12

Ube Cupcakes
2 eggs
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup oil
1/2 cup ube halaya jam
1 tsp ube extract
1/2 cup plain greek yogurt
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 cup flour

Ube Whipped Cream
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
3 tbsp granulated sugar
1 1/2 tbsp instant vanilla pudding powder
1 tsp ube extract

For Ube Cupcakes
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and prepare a cupcake tin with liners.
Using a stand or electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar until pale and fluffy.
Add oil and beat until homogenous.
In a separate bowl, mix ube jam, ube extract, and yogurt.
In another bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Alternate adding yogurt mixture and dry ingredients into your cake, mixing slowly and gently until all ingredients are just incorporated.
Scoop your batter into your lined cupcake tin (batter should come about 2/3 the way up the liner) and bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick stuck through the center comes out clean. Allow cupcakes to cool before frosting.

For Ube Whipped Cream
Put heavy whipping cream, granulated sugar, pudding mix, and ube extract in a mixing bowl. Beat until stiff peaks form.
Frost or pipe your whipped cream onto the cupcakes after the cupcakes have completely cooled. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge.
