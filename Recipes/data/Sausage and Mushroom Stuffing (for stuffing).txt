Sausage and Mushroom Stuffing

1 1/2 pounds white sandwich bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 12 cups)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 pound bulk pork sausage
12 oz mushrooms diced
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for baking dish
2 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
4 celery stalks chopped fine (about 1 cup)
3 teaspoons Kosher salt 
1 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon minced fresh marjoram leaves
2 tablespoons minced fresh sage leaves
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 
2 large eggs

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Spread bread cubes in single layer on baking sheet; bake until edges have dried but center is slightly moist (cubes should yield to pressure), about 45 minutes, stirring several times during baking. Transfer dried bread to large bowl and increase oven temperature to 325 degrees.

2. While bread dries, heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sausage and cook, stirring to break sausage into 1/2-inch pieces, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to paper towel-lined plate. Return skillet to heat and add 4 tablespoons butter to fat in skillet. When foaming subsides, add onion, celery, 4 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften and brown slightly, 7 to 10 minutes. Cook mushrooms, 4 minutes. Stir in thyme, marjoram, and sage; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vegetable mixture and sausage to bowl with dried bread; add 1 cup broth and toss until evenly moistened (you should have about 12 cups stuffing).

3. Use stuffing as directed in Old-Fashioned Stuffed Turkey recipe, adding eggs and remaining 1/2 cup broth in step 7.

7. While turkey rests, reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees. Whisk eggs and remaining 1/2 cup broth together in small bowl. Pour egg mixture over stuffing and toss to combine, breaking up any large chunks; spread in buttered 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Bake until stuffing registers 165 degrees and top is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Carve turkey and serve stuffing.
