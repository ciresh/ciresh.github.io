Miso Honey Chicken

3 tablespoons white miso
2 tablespoons honey
¼ cup rice vinegar
2 teaspoons hot sauce
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 whole chicken, halved, wing tips separated
kosher salt to taste
½ lemon, cut into wedges, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Combine miso and honey in a bowl. Pour in rice vinegar, followed by hot sauce and 1 tablespoon salt. Whisk well until mostly smooth.

Cut 3 to 4 slashes into legs and thighs of chicken halves. Toss chicken in the marinade until well coated. Refrigerate for 2 to 12 hours.

Flip chicken over in the bowl. Sprinkle more kosher salt on top.

Preheat a grill to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) over indirect heat.

Place chicken on the grill and cover. Grill for 20 minutes and flip chicken over. Cover and grill for another 20 minutes.

Brush the excess marinade on top of chicken. Cover again and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 10 minutes more.

Plate chicken alongside lemon wedges sprinkled with cayenne pepper. Squeeze some spicy lemon over chicken as you cut it up.
