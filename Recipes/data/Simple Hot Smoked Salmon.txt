Simple Hot Smoked Salmon

1/2 cup Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt (or 6 Tablespoons Morton Kosher Salt)
1/2 cup granulated sugar

Place the salmon skin-side down on a wire cooling rack over a rimmed baking sheet pan. Apply all of the curing mixture to the flesh side of the salmon in an even layer, pressing lightly to ensure good contact between cure and flesh.

Move the salmon to the refrigerator to cure uncovered for 4 hours.

Return the salmon to the refrigerator to dry uncovered for 4 to 20 hours, until the surface is tacky.

Run the cooker at 225-275°F, adjusting the bottom vents as necessary to maintain this temperature range.

Cook the salmon to an internal temperature of 120-125°F measured with an instant-read thermometer. Check the internal temp in the thickest part of the salmon; thinner areas will measure 130°F or a bit higher.
