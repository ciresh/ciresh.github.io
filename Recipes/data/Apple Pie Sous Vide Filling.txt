Apple Pie Sous Vide Filling

https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/gjmqu0/kenjis_apple_pie_sous_vided_fillings/

I've actually found Kenji's recommended Yellow Delicious apples (a variety most people would never think of for pies) end up being too crunchy if you follow the sous vide temp recommended in the apple pie filling article. I did quite a few experiments and ended up with: 160°F x 1 h (set the pectin) then 185°F x 1 hr (increase tenderness while maintaining the structure) before filling the pie and baking. It's a game changer. Also based this in part on the sous vide apple pie in Taylor & Arguin's The New Pie: Modern Techniques for the Classic American Dessert cookbook (their sous vide apple pie is pictured on the cover). Of course, if you are trying to win national baking competitions, you have to up your game to the next level (they won Best in Show at the National Pie Contest a couple of years ago)!
