Czech Bread Dumplings (Knedlíky)

1 cup warm milk (105 degrees F (40 degrees C))
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg, beaten
2 3/4 cups quick-mixing flour (such as Wondra®), or more as needed

Combine warm milk, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Let sit and bloom for about 10 minutes.

Add egg and kosher salt to the yeast mixture. Pour in 2 ¾ cups flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until it starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and forms a dough.

Knead on a lightly floured surface until dough is smooth and slightly elastic, about 3 minutes.

Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, flipping the dough to coat the top in oil. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Transfer back to your work surface; press out the excess air and form dough into a relatively uniform ball.

Cut dough into two equal pieces. Form each piece into a uniform ball. Roll each ball into a tube, 2 to 2 ½ inches wide.

Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let proof for 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a steady simmer.

Carefully pick up a risen piece of dough and transfer to the simmering water. Bring back to a simmer. Cover tightly and let simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover, flip, and continue to simmer for another 10 minutes.

Transfer to a plate and poke all over with a toothpick or wooden skewer, which releases the steam from the center.

Use a piece of string or thread to cut into 3/4- to 1-inch dumplings. Transfer to a serving plate.

Repeat Steps 9 to 11 to cook remaining dough.

You can substitute half all-purpose flour and half semolina flour for Wondra® if you can't find it.
