Ingredients
250 g plain flour
125 g cold butter (pastry)
90 g caster sugar
1 large egg, beaten
370 g 70% dark chocolate
400 ml double cream
25 g honey
85 g butter (filling)
1 handful cocoa nibs to decorate

Rub the cubed butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Stir through the sugar and beaten egg. Knead gently until the whole thing forms a soft dough ball - don't overwork or else the pastry will be tough when cooked.
Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least an hour to relax.
Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a pound coin. Lay over a large 24cm tart case and gently press into the edges, trim off any excessive pastry.
Line the inside of the tart case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans, then chill again for 15 mins.
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C and bake the case for 15 mins, then remove the beans and paper to cook for another 5 mins. Leave to cool.
Break up the dark chocolate into a large bowl with the butter and honey.
Grab a pan and heat the cream until it is about to boil. Remove from the heat and pour it over the dark chocolate. Stir until the chocolate and butter has fully melted and the mixture becomes glossy.
Pour the chocolate into the cooled tart case and leave to cool in the fridge.
Decorate with coca nibs and slice the tart with a hot knife for a clean finish. Serves 10
