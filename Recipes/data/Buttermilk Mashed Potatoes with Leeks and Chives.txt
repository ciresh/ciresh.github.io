Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes with Leeks and Chives
from the Episode: Dinner on a Dime
from the Companion Book: Cooking at Home

To achieve the proper texture, it important to cook the potatoes thoroughly; they are done if they break apart when a knife is inserted and gently wiggled. Buttermilk substitutes like clabbered milk do not produce sufficiently tangy potatoes. To reduce the chances of curdling, the buttermilk must be brought to room temperature and mixed with cooled melted butter.

Serves 4
2 	pounds Yukon Gold potatoes , peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 	bay leaf 
	Table salt 
7 	tablespoons unsalted butter (6 tablespoons, melted and cooled)
1 	medium leek , white and light green parts, rinsed well, quartered, and cut into 1/4-inch slices
2/3 	cup buttermilk , at room temperature
3 	tablespoons minced fresh chives 
	Ground black pepper

1. Place potatoes and bay leaf in large saucepan, add cold water to cover by 1 inch and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes break apart when paring knife is inserted, about 18 minutes. Drain potatoes, discard bay leaf, and return potatoes to saucepan set on still-hot burner.

2. While potatoes are cooking, melt 1 tablespoon butter in small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and wilted, about 8 minutes.

3. Using potato masher, mash potatoes until a few small lumps remain. Gently add 6 tablespoons melted butter and buttermilk to small bowl and mix until combined. Add butter-buttermilk mixture, leeks, and chives to potatoes; using rubber spatula, fold gently until just incorporated. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper; serve immediately.
