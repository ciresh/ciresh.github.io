Unstuffed Chicken Breasts with Dijon, Ham, and Gruyere

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Salt and ground black pepper
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
4 slices baked deli ham
cup shredded Gruy√®re or Swiss cheese 
Ritz crackers, crushed coarse (3/4 cup)
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon minced fresh dill or parsley

While the chicken is browning, shred the cheese and crush the crackers.

Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees.

Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown chicken lightly on one side, about 3 minutes.

Off heat, turn chicken over. Spread 1 teaspoon of mustard over each breast, then lay 1 slice ham on top. Mound 1/4 cup of cheese over ham. Sprinkle cracker crumbs over cheese and press on crumbs to adhere.

Whisk cream, wine, and dill together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup and pour into skil let around chicken, without disturbing crumbs. Return skillet to medium-high heat and bring to simmer. Immediately transfer to oven. Bake until thickest part of chicken breast registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 12 to 15 minutes.

Transfer chicken to individual plates. Whisk remaining 2 teaspoons mustard into sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.
