Chicken Souvlaki

2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs
125g (1/2c) olive oil
15g (1T) salt
30g (5-6 cloves) minced garlic
5g (3 tsp) dried oregano
5g (1 3/4t) black pepper
100g (1/3c) Dijon mustard (preferably Maille or Grey Poupon)
Zest of 2 lemons
Juice of 1 lemon (approx. 30g or 2T)
Skewers (for grilling)

350g (3c) all-purpose flour
7g (2t) instant yeast
5g (1t) salt
8g (2t) sugar
15g (1T) olive oil
210g (3/4 cup) flavorful yeasty beer, warmed to 86-90°F (30C)

For the Tzatziki Sauce:
160g (1 large) english cucumber, grated
200g (3/4c) plain Greek yogurt
75g (1/3c) mayonnaise
1 clove garlic, minced
5g (1t) salt
5g (2T) chopped fresh dill
15-20g lemon juice (approx 1/2 Lemon)

For the Tomato-Onion Relish:
120g (2 medium) tomatoes, diced
60g (1/2) red onion, finely diced
20g (1/3 cup) chopped parsley

Cut the chicken thighs into roughly 1-inch pieces. 

To the chicken, add olive oil, salt, garlic, oregano, black pepper, Dijon, lemon zest and  juice. Mix well & refrigerate to marinate for at least 30 minutes, up to 24 hours.

Make the Pita Dough while chicken marinates. In a food processor, combine flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and olive oil. Pulse 5 times to mix. With the processor running, slowly add the warmed beer until the dough forms. It will be shaggy.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 2 minutes, until it becomes slightly elastic.

Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces (about 150g each, or smaller as the ). Shape each into a ball, cover with a damp paper towel, and let rest at room temp for 15 minutes.

To prepare the Tzatziki Sauce, grate the cucumber and squeeze out excess water. In a mixing bowl, combine the grated cucumber, yogurt, mayo, garlic, salt, dill, and lemon juice. Stir until well mixed.

Roll Out the Pita Dough: Lightly flour a surface and roll out each ball of dough to about 8"/20cm in diameter.

Grill the Pita and Chicken: Preheat the grill to 550°F/285C. Skewer the marinated chicken and grill alongside the pita bread. Grill pitas for about 2 minutes per side. Grill chicken skewers for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally until well charred on all sides.

Assemble the Souvlaki Wrap: Remove chicken from skewers and chop into smaller pieces. Place chicken in a pita, top with tzatziki sauce, tomato-onion relish, and pepperoncini.
