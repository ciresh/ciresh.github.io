BBQ Macaroni Salad

Serves 8 to 10

We like the sweet, smoky flavor of Texas Best or Bull's-Eye barbecue sauce here, but feel free to substitute your favorite. As the salad sits, it can become dry; just before serving, stir in a few tablespoons of warm water to bring back its creamy texture.
	Table salt 
1 	pound elbow macaroni 
1 	red bell pepper , seeded and chopped fine
1 	rib celery , chopped fine
4 	scallions , sliced thin
2 	tablespoons cider vinegar 
1 	teaspoon hot sauce 
1 	teaspoon chili powder 
1/8 	teaspoon garlic powder 
	Pinch cayenne pepper 
1 	cup mayonnaise 
1/2 	cup barbecue sauce (see note above)
	Ground black pepper 

1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add 1 tablespoon salt and macaroni and cook until nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain in colander and rinse with cold water until cool, then drain once more, briefly, so that pasta is still moist; transfer to large bowl.

2. Stir in bell pepper, celery, scallions, vinegar, hot sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper, and let sit until flavors are absorbed, about 2 minutes. Stir in mayonnaise and barbecue sauce and let sit until salad is no longer watery, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve. (The salad can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Check seasonings before serving.)
