Apple Butter Muffins


Batter:
2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg, beaten
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup oil
3/4 cup Raven’s Nest Apple Butter

Topping:
1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup walnuts
4 tablespoons butter, chilled and cut into ½ inch chunks

Glaze:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1-2 tablespoons apple cider

Preheat oven to 425°. Line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper liners.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and kosher salt.
In a smaller bowl, mix beaten egg, milk and oil until well combined.
Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and mix just until combined. Be careful not to overmix.
Combine topping ingredients in a small bowl. Cut in butter with a fork, pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture is crumbly.
Spoon a little bit of batter into each muffin cup, about a tablespoon. Then spoon in a tablespoon of apple butter into each muffin cup and sprinkle in a little bit of the topping mixture.
Next, distribute the remaining batter among the muffin cups. Top each muffin with the remaining topping mixture.
Bake for 5 minutes and then reduce the oven heat to 350°. Bake for 15-17 minutes longer, until a tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
Cool for 15 minutes.
Combine the glaze ingredients. Drizzle over cooled muffins.
