2/2005

Roasted red peppers are sold in jars of different sizes. One 12-ounce jar is enough for this recipe. Sun-dried tomatoes can be substituted for the roasted red peppers. This recipe also works well with penne.

Serves 4 to 6
1 	pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts , sliced into 1-inch pieces
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
3 	tablespoons unsalted butter 
1 	onion , minced
1/4 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
1/4 	teaspoon dried oregano 
3 	cloves garlic , minced
8 	ounces ziti (2 /12 cups)
2 	cups low-sodium chicken broth 
1 	cup milk 
1 	bunch broccoli (1 1/2 pounds), stems discarded and florets cut into 1-inch pieces
1 	cup jarred roasted red peppers , rinsed and sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 	ounce Parmesan cheese , grated (1/2 cup)
2 	tablespoons fresh lemon juice (optional)


1. Pat the chicken dry, then season with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until it is lightly browned but not fully cooked, about 4 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a bowl.

2. Add 1 more tablespoon of the butter, the onion, red pepper flakes, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds.

3. Sprinkle the ziti evenly into the skillet. Pour the broth and milk over the ziti. Cover and bring to a simmer, about 2 minutes.

4. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the broccoli and roasted peppers. Cover and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta begins to soften and the broccoli turns bright green, about 8 minutes.

5. Stir in the chicken and any accumulated juice. Cover and continue to simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 3 minutes longer.

6. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the Parmesan, and lemon juice (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
