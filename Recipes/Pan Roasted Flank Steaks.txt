Pan-Roasted Flank Steak with Garlic-Chile Marinade     


Marinade
6 tablespoons vegetable oil 
6 medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)
2 medium scallions , minced (about 3 tablespoons)
1 canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce , minced (about 1 tablespoon)
1 medium jalapeño chile , minced (about 1 tablespoon)

Steak
1 flank steak (about 2 pounds), patted dry with paper towels
2 teaspoons kosher salt 
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
2 teaspoons vegetable oil 
	
 


1. For Marinade: Puree all ingredients in blender until smooth, scraping down blender jars as needed.

2. For Steak: Using dinner fork, poke steak about 20 times on each side. Place on rimmed baking sheet or in large baking dish; rub both sides of steak evenly with salt and then with paste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.

3. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 450 degrees. Using paper towels, wipe paste off flank steak; season both sides of steak evenly with pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Set steak in skillet and cook until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip steak; sear until second side is well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Place skillet in oven and roast until slightly less done than desired, about 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare. Using potholders to handle skillet, transfer steak to cutting board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Using sharp chef's knife or carving knife, slice steak about 1/4 inch thick against grain on bias. Serve immediately.

Although it may seem that a 2-pound steak will not fit in the skillet, it will. The steak will initially slope up the sides of the pan, but it will shrink as it cooks to fit the skillet. Resting after pan-roasting this steak is crucial—it allows the steak to continue cooking to the proper temperature (130 degrees for medium-rare) and lets the juices become evenly redistributed throughout the steak.
