Cornflake-Crusted Baked Chicken
Serves 8 | Prep time: 30 minutes | Total time: 1 hour
    
4 bone-in, skinless chicken drumsticks
4 bone-in skinless chicken thighs
Coarse salt and ground pepper
1 large egg
2 cups crushed cornflakes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

Preheat oven to 400Â°. Rinse chicken, and pat dry. Season generously with salt and pepper.

In a small bowl, whisk egg with 1 tablespoon water. In a large bowl, mix cornflakes with oil, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt.

Working with one piece of chicken at a time, dip chicken in egg mixture, then coat with seasoned cornflakes, pressing flakes to help them adhere. Transfer coated pieces to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper before serving.
