Really Good Oven-Fried Buffalo Wings

4 pounds chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 cup of your favorite wing sauce (the classic is a half and half mixture of Frank's Hot Sauce and melted butter)
Blue cheese dressing
Celery sticks
Procedure
1. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, and set rack inside. Dry chicken wings with paper towels. Place 1/3 of wings in large bowl, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt, and toss until thoroughly and evenly coated. Place on rack, leaving slight space between each wing. Repeat with remaining two batches of wings.
2. Place baking sheet with wings in refrigerator and allow to rest, uncovered, at least 8 hours, and up to 18 hours.
3. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450Â°F. Add chicken wings and cook for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes longer. Transfer to large bowl, add sauce, toss to thoroughly coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, conspicuously shunning anyone who says that real buffalo wings must be fried.
