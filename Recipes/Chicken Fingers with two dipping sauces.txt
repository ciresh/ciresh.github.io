Chicken Fingers with two dipping sauces
Serves 4 | Prep time: 20 minutes| Total time: 1 hour 20 minutes 
 
ingredients 
  
½ cup low-fat buttermilk 
2 teaspoons honey 
1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips 
2/3 cups plain dried breadcrumbs 
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for rack  
Coarse salt 


3 tablespoons apricot jam 
7 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
½ cup crumbled blue cheese
1 scallion, thinly sliced


If marinating the chicken in a resealable bag, place it on a plate to catch any drips. 

In a large bowl or resealable plastic bag, combine ½ cup buttermilk and honey.  Add chicken, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight, turning occasionally. 
Heat broiler.  Spread breadcrumbs on a plate.  Lift chicken from buttermilk; dredge in breadcrumbs, patting them in.  Lightly oil a rack large enough to hold chicken in a single layer; place rack on a baking sheet.  Arrange chicken on a rack, and brush chicken with oil. 
Broil 4 inches from heat source (without turning), until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle with salt. 
Meanwhile, prepare sauces: In a small bowl, stir together jam, 6 teaspoons lemon juice, and mustard.  In a separate bowl, stir together blue cheese and remaining ¼ cup buttermilk and teaspoon lemon juice; sprinkle with scallion.  Serve sauces with chicken fingers.
