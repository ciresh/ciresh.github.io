Source: Cooks Illustrated 11/1998



Serves 6
1/3 cup port 
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar 
4 ounces dried figs (6 large or 12 small), stems removed
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
2 medium shallots or 1/4 small red onion, minced (about 3 tablespoons)
1/4 teaspoon table salt 
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
2 large bunches arugula , washed, dried, and leaves torn into bite-sized pieces (about 3 cups, loosely packed)
1 medium head escarole , washed, dried, and torn into bite-sized pieces (about 6 cups, loosely packed)
1/4 pound blue cheese (preferably Roquefort or Stilton), crumbled


1. Bring port, sugar, and figs to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Cover pan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until figs are very soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes. Reserving liquid in pan, remove figs with slotted spoon and, when cool enough to handle, quarter and set them aside.

2. Whisk vinegar, shallots, salt, and pepper into port; gradually whisk in oil. Return figs to dressing and reheat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until warm but not steaming.

3. Toss greens and warm dressing to coat in large mixing bowl. Divide dressed greens among 6 serving plates, sprinkle with a portion of blue cheese, and serve immediately.
