  Serves 4 | Prep time: 15 minutes | Total time: 1 hour 10 minutes 
  
ingredients 
  3 cups fresh orange juice (5 to 6 oranges)
1/2 cup red-wine vinegar
1/4 cup molasses
4 bone-in skinless chicken breast halves (8 ounces each)
Coarse salt and ground pepper



Preheat oven to 400°. In a large skillet, combine juice, vinegar, and molasses. Boil over high heat, skimming foam occasionally, until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Reserve half the glaze for serving. 
Place chicken breasts on a rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Season generously with salt and pepper, and brush with glaze. 
Bake chicken, brush with glaze twice, until juices run clear when pierced, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve hot with reserved glaze.
