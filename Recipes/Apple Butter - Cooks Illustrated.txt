WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
Although it’s in the same family as applesauce, apple butter goes a step further, requiring cooking down apples to concentrate their flavor, drive off water, and caramelize their sugars for a dark, complex-tasting spread that is ideal for serving with baked goods or cheese or as a sandwich… read more

MAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS

A food mill is the easiest way to remove the skins and puree the apples.

INGREDIENTS

2 pounds McIntosh apples, cored, quartered, and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 pounds Fuji apples, cored, quartered, and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup apple cider
1 cup Calvados or applejack
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar
1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) packed light brown sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
INSTRUCTIONS
1. Combine apples, cider, and Calvados in large Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until apples are very soft, about 30 minutes.

2. Working in batches, transfer apples to food mill and process. Discard skins and transfer puree to now-empty Dutch oven. Stir in granulated sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, and salt. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture is browned and thickened and rubber spatula or wooden spoon leaves distinct trail when dragged across bottom of pot, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

3. Transfer apple butter to jar with tight-fitting lid and let cool completely before covering and refrigerating. Apple butter can be refrigerated for up to 1 month.
