Crispy Potato Pancakes
Love potato pancakes but hate the tedious steps of peeling, shredding, and squeezing excess moisture from the potatoes? The Cook's Country team discovered that frozen shredded hash-brown potatoes are a surprisingly effective shortcut. Don't want to fry potato pancakes on the stovetop? A preheated oiled baking sheet delivers almost as much crispness, with far less mess.

Serves 4

    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    * 5 cups frozen shredded hash-brown potatoes
    * 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
    * 1 large egg
    * 2 scallions, chopped fine
    * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 teaspoon pepper

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Coat rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil.

2. Place hash browns and butter in large microwave-safe bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave on high power until butter is melted and hash browns are defrosted, about 5 minutes. Remove plastic wrap, stir well, and let cool.

3. Whisk egg, scallions, cornstarch, salt, and pepper together in medium bowl until thoroughly combined. Add to hash-brown mixture and stir until incorporated. Using 3 tablespoons hash-brown mixture, form ball and place on large plate; repeat to make total of 10 balls.

4. Place oiled baking sheet in oven and heat until just beginning to smoke, about 6 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and, working quickly, place potato balls on hot baking sheet. Spray each with cooking spray, then press into 1/2-inch-thick disk using metal spatula (spray back of spatula with cooking spray if potato balls start to stick). Bake until potato pancakes are golden brown on bottom, about 10 minutes. Flip pancakes over, press down using metal spatula, and bake until crisp and golden brown, about 8 minutes. Place on paper towel-lined plate to drain briefly. Serve.
