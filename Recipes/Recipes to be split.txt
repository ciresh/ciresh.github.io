Southwestern Beef Kebabs
5/2000

Our favorite cut of beef for kebabs is top blade steak (known sometimes as blade or flatiron steak), but you can also use top sirloin. If you do, ask the butcher to cut the top sirloin steak between 1 and 1 1/4 inches thick (most packaged sirloin steaks are thinner). If desired, add 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary, thyme, basil, or oregano to the garlic and oil mixture for this marinade. For maximum efficiency, prepare the fruit and vegetables while the meat is marinating.

Serves 4 to 6 as a main course

Marinade
1/4 	cup extra-virgin olive oil 
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced
1/2 	teaspoon ground cumin 
1/2 	teaspoon chili powder 
1 	chipotle chile en adobo , minced
2 	tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves , minced
3/4 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
2 	pounds blade steaks (about 4 to 5 steaks), trimmed of fat and prepared according to illustrations

Fruit and Vegetables
1 	large pineapple (about 3 1/2 pounds), peeled, ends trimmed, halved lengthwise, core removed, and each piece cut into six chunks
1 	medium red bell pepper (about 5 1/2 ounces), halved, cored, and each half cut into 9 chunks
1 	medium yellow bell pepper (about 5 1/2 ounces), halved, cored, and each half cut into 9 chunks
2 	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
	table salt 
	ground black pepper 
1 	large red onion (about 10 ounces), ends trimmed, peeled, halved lengthwise, inner core discarded, each half cut into four pieces, and each piece cut crosswise into thirds
	lemon wedges or lime wedges for serving (optional)


1. For the marinade: Combine oil, garlic, cumin, chili powder, chipotle chile en adobo, cilantro, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Add steak cubes and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate until fully seasoned, at least one hour or up to 24 hours.

2. Ignite 1 large chimney (about 6 quarts, or 5 pounds) of charcoal and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill and spread over three-quarters of grill surface. Position grill rack over coals; heat until hot, about 5 minutes. Scrape rack clean with wire brush.

3. For the fruit and vegetables: Toss pineapple and peppers with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Brush onions with remaining oil and season with salt and pepper. Using eight 12-inch metal skewers, thread each skewer with a pineapple piece, a stack of onion, a cube of meat (skewering as if it were an uncut cube), and one piece of each kind of pepper, and then repeat this sequence two more times. Brush any oil remaining in bowl over skewers.

4. Grill kebabs directly over coals, uncovered, until meat is well browned, grill marked, and cooked to medium-rare, about 7 minutes (or about 8 minutes for medium), turning each kabob every 1 3/4 minutes to brown all sides. Transfer kebabs to serving platter, squeeze lemon or lime wedges over kebabs, if desired; serve immediately.




STEP BY STEP: Cutting the Kebab Meat

1. Halve each steak lengthwise, leaving gristle on one half. 	
2. Cut away the gristle from the half to which it is still attached.

3. Cube meat, and cut each cube almost through at center.

American Potato Salad
Written: Jul 2004

Is there anything new to say about making this summertime classic? To find out,

The Problem: Why bother with a recipe for potato salad? After all, the main elements--potatoes, mayonnaise, and seasonings--are about as basic as they come. It's tempting to adopt a devil-may-care attitude, tossing boiled potatoes with a dollop of this and a squirt of that. But you can always tell when potato salad has been improvised, because the flavor is out of whack--too sweet or too acidic, underseasoned or overseasoned.

The Goal: Our goal was to nail down a good, solid formula for this summer side dish. We were looking for flavorful, tender potatoes punctuated by crunchy bits of onion and celery. An ideal dressing would have both a hint of sweetness and a measure of acidity.

The Solution: While developing other recipes for potato salad, the test kitchen has found that seasoning the potatoes while they're hot maximizes flavor. We did splashed hot russet potatoes with white vinegar and found them to be more flavorful than other types of potatoes treated the same way. Russets do crumble a bit when mixed, but tasters found this quality charming, not alarming. Just 1/2 cup mayonnaise dressed 2 pounds of potatoes perfectly. In the crunch department, celery is a must, and one rib fit the bill. Among scallions, shallots, and red, yellow, white, and Vidalia onions, red onion was the winner for its bright color and taste. For a pickled flavor, we decided on pickle relish, which requires no preparation and gives the potato salad a subtle sweetness. We tested celery seed, a seasoning that has fallen out of favor; celery seed didn't merely add strong celery flavor but also provided an underlying complexity and depth. Salt, pepper, and minced fresh parsley played their usual role of sharpening the other flavors. Hard-cooked eggs created some controversy, considered obligatory by some and a mistake by others--we leave the choice to the cook.

It may seem obvious, but it makes sense to mix the dressing first, then fold it into the potatoes. Several recipes we tested instructed the cook to add the dressing ingredients one by one; this led to excess mixing, which turned the potatoes to mush.

Note that this recipe calls for celery seed, not celery salt; if only celery salt is available, use the same amount but omit the addition of salt in the dressing. When testing the potatoes for doneness, simply taste a piece; do not overcook the potatoes or they will become mealy and will break apart. The potatoes must be just warm, or even fully cooled, when you add the dressing. If you find the potato salad a little dry for your liking, add up to 2 tablespoons more mayonnaise.
Serves 4 to 6
2 	pounds russet potatoes (3 to 4 medium), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
	table salt 
2 	tablespoons distilled white vinegar 
1 	medium rib celery , chopped fine (about 1/2 cup)
2 	tablespoons minced red onion 
3 	tablespoons sweet pickle relish 
1/2 	cup mayonnaise (see note)
3/4 	teaspoon mustard powder 
3/4 	teaspoon celery seed 
2 	tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves  
1/4 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
2 	large hard-cooked eggs , peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes (optional)
	
 


1. Place potatoes in large saucepan and add water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to boil over medium-high heat; add 1 tablespoon salt, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring once or twice, until potatoes are tender, about 8 minutes.

2. Drain potatoes and transfer to large bowl. Add vinegar and, using rubber spatula, toss gently to combine. Let stand until potatoes are just warm, about 20 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in small bowl, stir together celery, onion, pickle relish, mayonnaise, mustard powder, celery seed, parsley, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Using rubber spatula, gently fold dressing and eggs, if using, into potatoes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour; serve. (Potato salad can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.)

Family-Style Macaroni and Cheese
Written: May 2004

Neither dull nor excessively rich, macaroni and cheese should please a multitude of palates. Could we find a simple way to make this dish appealing to adults and kids alike?

The Problem: Sure, the kids would be fine with the contents of the blue box brand, but for us this ready-mix mac and cheese lost its appeal soon after we learned how to boil water. Conversely, decadent recipes replete with cream, eggs, and a who's-who list of pungent cheeses are decidedly adults-only; just try to serve them to the kids and you'll get upturned noses and pushed-back plates.

The Goal: Simple, satisfying macaroni and cheese, as appealing to adults as it is to children.

The Solution: Cook the pasta until just past al dente and then combine with a bÃ©chamel-based cheese sauce (classically known as Mornay sauce). Use a combination of sharp cheddar for flavor and Monterey Jack for creaminess. For a crunchy topping, toss homemade bread crumbs with melted butter, sprinkle over the casserole, and brown quickly under the broiler.

It's crucial to cook the pasta until tender--just past the "al dente" stage. In fact, overcooking is better than undercooking the pasta. Whole, low-fat, and skim milk all work well in this recipe. The recipe can be halved and baked in an 8-inch-square, broilersafe baking dish. If desired, offer celery salt or hot sauce (such as Tabasco) for sprinkling at the table.
Serves 6 to 8, or 10 to 12 as a side

Bread Crumb Topping
6 	slices white sandwich bread (good-quality, about 6 ounces), torn into rough pieces
3 	tablespoons unsalted butter (cold), cut into 6 pieces

1. For the bread crumbs: Pulse bread and butter in food processor until crumbs are no larger than 1/8 inch, ten to fifteen 1-second pulses. Set aside.

2. For the pasta and cheese: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat broiler. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat. Add macaroni and 1 tablespoon salt; cook until pasta is tender. Drain pasta and set aside in colander.

3. In now-empty Dutch oven, heat butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add flour, mustard, and cayenne (if using) and whisk well to combine. Continue whisking until mixture becomes fragrant and deepens in color, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk; bring mixture to boil, whisking constantly (mixture must reach full boil to fully thicken). Reduce heat to medium and simmer, whisking occasionally, until thickened to consistency of heavy cream, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in cheeses and 1 teaspoon salt until cheeses are fully melted. Add pasta and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is steaming and heated through, about 6 minutes.

4. Transfer mixture to broiler-safe 9-by 13-inch baking dish and sprinkle evenly with bread crumbs. Broil until crumbs are deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes, rotating pan if necessary for even browning. Cool about 5 minutes, then serve.

Written: 11/1993
If youâ€™re out of buttermilk, try this sweet-milk variation. By making your own baking powder using baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity of milk, you can make a thick, quite respectable batter. The result is a waffle with a crisp crust and moist interior.

Makes 3-4
1 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour 
1 	tablespoon cornmeal (optional)
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	teaspoon baking soda 
2 	teaspoons cream of tartar 
1 	egg , separated
3/4 	scant cup milk 
2 	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted
	


1. Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Whisk yolk with milk and butter.

2. Beat egg white until it just holds a 2-inch peak.

3. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients; gently fold egg white into batter.

4. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturerâ€™s instructions, cook waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5 minutes.)

The batter must be made 12 to 24 hours in advance. We prefer the texture of the waffles made in a classic waffle iron, but a Belgian waffle iron will work, though it will make fewer waffles. The waffles are best served fresh from the iron but can be held in an oven until all of the batter is used. As you make the waffles, place them on a wire rack set above a baking sheet, cover them with a clean kitchen towel, and place the baking sheet in a 200-degree oven. When the final waffle is in the iron, remove the towel to allow the waffles to crisp for a few minutes. These waffles are quite rich; buttering them before eating is not compulsory and, to some, may even be superfluous.

Seven 7-inch round or four 9-inch square waffles
1 3/4 	cups whole milk , or low-fat milk, or skim milk
8 	tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 8 pieces
2 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
1 	tablespoon granulated sugar 
1 	teaspoon table salt 
1 1/2 	teaspoons instant yeast 
2 	large eggs 
1 	teaspoon vanilla extract 
	


1. Heat milk and butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool milk/butter mixture until warm to touch. Meanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in large bowl to combine. Gradually whisk warm milk/butter mixture into flour mixture; continue to whisk until batter is smooth. In small bowl, whisk eggs and vanilla until combined, then add egg mixture to batter and whisk until incorporated. Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 12 and up to 24 hours.

2. Following manufacturerâ€™s instructions, heat waffle iron; remove waffle batter from refrigerator when waffle iron is hot (batter will be foamy and doubled in size). Whisk batter to recombine (batter will deflate). Bake waffles according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions (use about Â½ cup for 7-inch round iron and about 1 cup for 9-inch square iron). Serve waffles immediately or hold in low temperature oven (see above note).


Oven Fries
  Add to Favorites       Shopping List

Written: 1/2004
Take care to cut the potatoes into evenly sized wedges so that all of the pieces will cook at about the same rate. Although it isn't required, a nonstick baking sheet works particularly well for this recipe. It not only keeps the fries from sticking to the pan but, because of its dark color, encourages deep and even browning. Whether you choose a nonstick baking sheet or a regular baking sheet, make sure that it is heavy duty. The intense heat of the oven may cause lighter pans to warp.

Serves 3 to 4
3 	russet potatoes (about 8 ounces each), peeled, each potato cut lengthwise into 10 to 12 evenly sized wedges
5 	tablespoons vegetable oil or peanut oil
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
	


1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position; heat oven to 475 degrees. Place potatoes in large bowl and cover with hot tap water; soak 10 minutes. Meanwhile, coat 18 by 12-inch heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet (see note) with 4 tablespoons oil and sprinkle evenly with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside.

2. Drain potatoes. Spread potatoes out on triple layer of paper towels and thoroughly pat dry with additional paper towels. Rinse and wipe out now-empty bowl; return potatoes to bowl and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Arrange potatoes in single layer on prepared baking sheet; cover tightly with foil and bake 5 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until bottoms of potatoes are spotty golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating baking sheet after 10 minutes. Using metal spatula and tongs, scrape to loosen potatoes from pan, then flip each wedge, keeping potatoes in single layer. Continue baking until fries are golden and crisp, 5 to 15 minutes longer, rotating pan as needed if fries are browning unevenly.

3. Transfer fries to second baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste and serve.








Blueberry Pancakes

When fresh blueberries are not in season, frozen blueberries are a good alternative. To make sure that frozen berries do not bleed, rinse them under cool water in a mesh strainer until the water runs clear, then spread them on a paper towel-lined plate to dry. If you have buttermilk on hand, use 2 cups instead of the milk and lemon juice.

Makes sixteen 4-inch pancakes, serving 4 to 6
1 	tablespoon lemon juice from 1 lemon
2 	cups milk 
2 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
2 	tablespoons granulated sugar 
2 	teaspoons baking powder 
1/2 	teaspoon baking soda 
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	large egg 
3 	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted and cooled slightly
2 	teaspoons vegetable oil 
1 	cup fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries, preferably wild, rinsed and dried
	
Soured milk, made by adding a little lemon juice to regular milk, makes pancakes that are especially light and fluffy.


1. Whisk lemon juice and milk in medium bowl or large measuring cup; set aside to thicken while preparing other ingredients. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl to combine.

2. Whisk egg and melted butter into milk until combined. Make well in center of dry ingredients in bowl; pour in milk mixture and whisk very gently until just combined (a few lumps should remain). Do not over mix.

3. Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes; add 1 teaspoon oil and brush to coat skillet bottom evenly. Pour 1/4 cup batter onto 3 spots on skillet; sprinkle 1 tablespoon blueberries over each pancake. Cook pancakes until large bubbles begin to appear, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on second side, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes longer. Serve immediately, and repeat with remaining batter, using remaining vegetable oil only if necessary.




Lemon Ice
  Add to Favorites       Shopping List

Written: 7/2003
If your tap water has off flavors, filter it, if possible, before use in this recipe. Better still, use bottled water; tasters preferred lemon ice made with spring or mineral water. The addition of vodka yields the best texture, but it can be omitted if desired. Because freezers differ in temperature, a wide range of freezing times is given in the recipe. Lemon ice does not keep well; it's best served within an hour of being ready. If making it in advance is crucial, try the food processor method (see below); the ice cubes can be frozen for up to 5 days and can be processed--which takes no more than a couple of minutes--whenever you're ready. Leftovers, if you have any, can be brought back to life by breaking the mass into large chunks and pulsing the chunks in a food processor.

Makes generous 4 cups, serving 4 to 6
1 	cup lemon juice from 5 or 6 large lemons
1 	cup granulated sugar (7 ounces)
1/8 	teaspoon table salt 
2 1/4 	cups water , preferably spring water (see note)
2 	tablespoons vodka (optional)
	
Lemon ice requires only five ingredients (including water) but is surprisingly flavorful. (Photo of Master recipe, Lemon Ice).


1. Combine ingredients in medium (at least 3-quart) nonreactive bowl, whisking occasionally to dissolve sugar.

2. Freeze mixture until edges and surface have begun to harden, about 1 hour; whisk mixture, scraping sides and bottom of bowl. Continue to freeze, whisking every 30 minutes, until mixture is slushy and granular, 3 to 5 hours. Small amount of liquid may remain in bowl; give final stir before serving to incorporate. Scoop into chilled serving dishes and serve immediately.

Alternative Freezing Methods

TO FREEZE IN ICE CREAM MACHINE:
If your ice cream machine is one that requires that the canister be frozen, remember to put the canister in the freezer at least one day before you plan on using it. Also, the lemon mixture should be thoroughly chilled before it is added to the machine. The lemon ice can be served directly from the machine, even if made in a canister-style machine. Follow manufacturerâ€™s directions.

TO FREEZE IN ICE CUBE TRAY FOR PROCESSING IN FOOD PROCESSOR:
Pour mixture into two ice cube trays and freeze until thoroughly frozen, at least 2 1/2 hours (or up to 5 days).

talian Pasta and Bean Soup (Pasta E Fagioli)
  Add to Favorites       Shopping List

Written: 3/2003
This soup does not hold well because the pasta absorbs the liquid, becomes mushy, and leaves the soup dry. The soup can, however, be made in two stages. Once the beans are simmered with the tomatoes, before the broth and water are added, the mixture can be cooled and refrigerated for up to 3 days. When ready to complete the soup, discard the Parmesan rind (otherwise it will become stringy), add the liquid, bring the soup to a boil, and proceed with the recipe.

Makes about 4 quarts, serving 8 to 10
1 	tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
	extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling
3 	ounces pancetta or bacon, chopped fine
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
1 	medium rib celery , chopped fine (about 2/3 cup)
4 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 heaping tablespoon)
1 	teaspoon dried oregano 
1/4 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
3 	anchovy fillets , minced to paste (about 1 teaspoon)
	1 can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes with liquid
1 	piece Parmesan cheese rind , about 5 inches by 2 inches
	2 cans (15 1/2 ounces each) cannellini beans , drained and rinsed
3 1/2 	cups low-sodium chicken broth 
	table salt 
8 	ounces orzo or other small pasta (ditalini, tubetini, conchigliette)
1/4 	cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 
	Ground black pepper 
2 	ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 1 cup)
	
Cooking the beans with the pancetta, vegetables, and tomatoes--before adding any broth--boosted the flavor of the beans.


1. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking, about 2 minutes. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add onion and celery; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and anchovies; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Add cheese rind and beans; bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer to blend flavors, 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, 2 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt; increase heat to high and bring to boil. Add pasta and cook until tender, about 10 minutes (refer to package instructions to better estimate pasta cooking time).

2. Discard cheese rind. Off heat, stir in 3 tablespoons parsley; adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into individual bowls; drizzle each serving with olive oil and sprinkle with a portion of remaining parsley. Serve immediately, passing grated Parmesan separately.

  Add to Favorites       Shopping List

Written: 3/2003
Good choices for condiments include diced fresh tomatoes, diced avocado, sliced scallions, chopped red onion, chopped cilantro leaves, sour cream, and shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese. If you are a fan of spicy food, consider using a little more of the red pepper flakes or cayenne--or both. The flavor of the chili improves with age; if possible, make it a day or up to five days in advance and reheat before serving. Leftovers can be frozen for up to a month.

Makes about 3 quarts, serving 8 to 10
2 	tablespoons vegetable oil or corn oil
2 	medium onions , chopped fine (about 2 cups)
1 	red bell pepper , cut into 1/2-inch cubes
6 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)
1/4 	cup chili powder 
1 	tablespoon ground cumin 
2 	teaspoons ground coriander 
1 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
1 	teaspoon dried oregano 
1/2 	teaspoon cayenne pepper 
2 	pounds 85% lean ground beef 
	2 cans (16 ounces each) kidney beans (dark), drained and rinsed
	1 can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes , with juice
	1 can (28 ounces) tomato puree 
	table salt 
2 	limes , cut into wedges
	
For the meatiest flavor, we used all ground beef and eliminated the liquids called for in other chili recipes.


1. Heat oil in large heavy-bottomed nonreactive Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, oregano, and cayenne; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add half the beef; cook, breaking up pieces with wooden spoon, until no longer pink and just beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add remaining beef and cook, breaking up pieces with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 3 to 4 minutes.

2. Add beans, tomatoes, tomato puree, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Remove cover and continue to simmer 1 hour longer, stirring occasionally (if chili begins to stick to bottom of pot, stir in 1/2 cup water and continue to simmer), until beef is tender and chili is dark, rich, and slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning with additional salt. Serve with lime wedges and condiments if desired.
