Simple Refried Beans

MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS

INGREDIENTS

2 slices bacon
1 small onion, chopped fine
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans (do not rinse)
1/4 cup water
Kosher salt
INSTRUCTIONS
Heat bacon in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until fat renders and bacon crisps, 7 to 10 minutes, flipping bacon halfway through. Remove bacon and reserve for another use. Increase heat to medium, add onion to fat in skillet, and cook until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beans and their liquid and water and bring to simmer. Cook, mashing beans with potato masher, until mixture is mostly smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt to taste, and serve.
