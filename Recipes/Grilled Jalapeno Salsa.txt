Grilled Jalapeno Salsa
Makes about 3 cups

In addition to serving this salsa with tortilla chips, you might try mixing it in with pasta--about a tablespoon or so per serving. You'll still get a good dose of heat.
INGREDIENTS
2  	tablespoons  vegetable oil 
1  	medium clove  garlic , minced
6  	plum tomatoes , halved
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
10  	large jalapeño chiles , stems removed
1/4  	cup  lime juice from 2 medium limes
1/4  	cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves  
1/4  	cup  olive oil 
1. Mix 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and garlic together in small bowl; rub tomato halves with this mixture, then sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Place over medium-hot fire and grill, turning once, until they begin to color, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from grill, cool to room temperature, dice, and transfer to medium bowl; set aside.
2. Rub peppers with remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil and grill over same medium-hot fire until slightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from fire and cool to room temperature; seed, mince, and add to tomatoes.
3. Mix remaining ingredients with tomatoes and peppers. Cover and refrigerate to blend flavors, at least 1 hour or up to 4 days.
