Meaty portobellos are paired with flavorful pancetta in this appetizer. Keep 
the cooked quesadillas warm in an oven set to low heat while you're

Pico de Gallo: 
1 1/2  cups chopped plum tomato 
1/3  cup chopped red onion 
1/4  cup chopped fresh cilantro 
2  tablespoons finely chopped seeded jalapeño pepper 
1  tablespoon fresh lime juice 
1/4  teaspoon kosher salt 
1/4  teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
2  garlic cloves, minced 

Quesadillas: 
2  ounces chopped pancetta or bacon 
8  cups (1/4-inch-thick) sliced portabella mushroom(about 1 pound) 
1  cup (4 ounces) reduced-fat shredded cheddar cheese 
8  (8-inch) fat-free flour tortillas 
Cooking spray 
3/4  cup fat-free sour cream 

To prepare pico de gallo, combine first 8 ingredients in a medium bowl. 

To prepare quesadillas, cook pancetta in a large nonstick skillet over 
medium-high heat until crisp. Remove pancetta from pan with a slotted spoon; 
place in a medium bowl. Add mushrooms to drippings in pan; sauté 6 minutes 
or until tender. Add mushrooms to pancetta in bowl; toss well. 

Wipe pan clean with paper towels. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese over each of 
4 tortillas; top each with 1/2 cup mushroom mixture, 2 tablespoons cheese, 
and 1 tortilla. Lightly coat top tortillas with cooking spray. Heat pan 
coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Place 1 quesadilla in pan; 
cook 2 minutes on each side or until tortillas are lightly browned. Set 
aside and keep warm. Repeat procedure with remaining quesadillas. Cut each 
quesadilla into 6 wedges. Serve with pico de gallo and sour cream.
