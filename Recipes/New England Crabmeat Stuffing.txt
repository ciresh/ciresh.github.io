New England Crabmeat Stuffing
Note: This is a basic and very neutral seafood stuffing. No lemon or wine is used which eliminates the tartness that will clash with complimentary sauces such as Newburg or White Clam Sauces. This stuffing goes very well with Flounder, Scrod, or Haddock and is also a very nice stuffing for broiled mushrooms. 

Preparation Time: Approx. 20 minutes
Yield: 4 portions or enough to serve with 2 lbs. of fish

Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
¼ cup minced onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
½ cup snow crab
¼ cup clam juice
½ teaspoon Lea & Perrins
¼ teaspoon of salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
½ teaspoon parsley flakes
3 cups fresh bread crumbs

Method:
In a food processor chop enough fresh bread to yield 3-4 cups. By fresh bread I mean do not use commercial bread crumbs, make your own crumbs. Frozen or day old bread will make the best bread crumbs. Using fresh bread will result in a sticky heavy stuffing.

In a sauté pan melt the butter and lightly sauté the onion and garlic. Add the crabmeat, sauté for about a minute and then add the clam juice, the Lea & Perrins, and the salt, pepper, and parsley. Bring the mixture to a strong simmer and remove from the fire. Add the bread crumbs a little at a time until a moderately stiff consistency is reached. Add only the amount of bread crumbs that is needed to completely absorb the liquid.
