Partial thawing of the spinach produces a cold dip that can be served without further chilling. If you don?t own a microwave, the frozen spinach can be thawed at room temperature for 11/2 hours then squeezed of excess liquid. The garlic must be minced or pressed before going into the food processor; otherwise the dip will contain large chunks of garlic. If making this dip in advance, hold off on sprinkling the bacon over it until just before serving.

Makes about 1 1/2 cups
3 	slices bacon cut into 14-inch pieces
10 	ounces frozen chopped spinach 
1/2 	cup sour cream 
1/2 	cup mayonnaise 
2 	tablespoons thin-sliced scallions white parts only, from 3 medium scallions
1/2 	cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaf 
1 	small clove garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
1/4 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
1 1/2 	ounces blue cheese , crumbled (about 1/3 cup)
	


1. Cut bacon into 1/4-inch pieces and fry in small skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and browned, about 5 minutes; using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined plate and set aside.

2. Thaw spinach in microwave for 3 minutes at 40 percent power. (Edges should be thawed but not warm; center should be soft enough to be broken apart into icy chunks.) Squeeze partially frozen spinach of excess water.

3. In food processor, process spinach, sour cream, mayonnaise, scallions, parsley, garlic, pepper, and crumbled blue cheese until smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to medium bowl and sprinkle bacon over dip; serve. (Dip can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 2 days.)
