Coquito makes about 6 cups
1 15-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
1 13.5-ounce can light coconut milk
1 12 ounce can evaporated milk
1 cup white rum
4 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg

Coquito
2 egg yolks, beaten
 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
 1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut
 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
 1/2 cup white rum
 1/2 cup water
 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 
 In the top of a double boiler, combine egg yolks and evaporated milk. Stirring constantly, cook over lightly simmering water until mixture reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Transfer mixture to a blender, and add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, cloves, cinnamon, and vanilla. Blend for about 30 seconds. Pour into glass bottles, and chill overnight.
