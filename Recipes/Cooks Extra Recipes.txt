The test kitchen prefers part-skim ricotta for manicotti, but whole or fat-free ricotta can also be used. We also prefer Barilla no-boil noodles for their delicate texture resembling fresh pasta. Note that Pasta Defino and Ronzoni brands contain only 12 no-boil noodles per package; the recipe requires 16 noodles. The manicotti can be prepared through step 5, covered with a sheet of parchment paper, wrapped in aluminum foil, and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month. (If frozen, thaw the manicotti in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.) To bake, remove the parchment, replace the aluminum foil, and increase baking time to 1 to 1 1/4 hours.

Serves 6 to 8

Tomato Sauce
	2 (28-ounce) cans diced tomatoes (in juice)
2 	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1/4-1/2 	teaspoon hot red pepper flakes , optional
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
2 	tablespoons chopped fresh basil  

Cheese Filling and Pasta
3 	cups part-skim ricotta cheese (see note above)
4 	ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 cups)
8 	ounces shredded mozzarella cheese (about 2 cups)
2 	large eggs , lightly beaten
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
2 	tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves  
2 	tablespoons chopped fresh basil  
16 	no-boil lasagna noodles (see note above)
16 	slices thinly sliced prosciutto 
	
Forget tricky stuffing methods. Our recipe relies on no-boil lasagna noodles and a simple filling technique.

1. For the sauce: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Process 1 can tomatoes with their juice in food processor until coarsely chopped with 1/4-inch pieces visible, 3 or 4 pulses. Transfer tomatoes to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining can tomatoes.

2. Heat oil, garlic, and pepper flakes (if using) in large saucepan over medium heat until fragrant but not brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and salt and simmer until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in basil; adjust seasoning with salt.

3. For the cheese filling: Combine ricotta, 1 cup Parmesan, mozzarella, eggs, salt, pepper, and herbs in medium bowl; set aside.

4. To assemble: Pour 1 inch boiling water in 13 by 9-inch broiler-safe baking dish, then add noodles 1 at a time. Let noodles soak until pliable, about 5 minutes, separating noodles with tip of sharp knife to prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water and place in single layer on clean kitchen towels; discard water in baking dish and dry baking dish.

5. Spread bottom of baking dish evenly with 1 1/2 cups sauce. Arrange 1 slice of prosciutto on each noodle. Using soupspoon, spread 1/4 cup cheese mixture evenly onto bottom 3/4 of each noodle on top of prosciutto (with short side facing you), leaving top 1/4 of noodle uncovered. Roll into tube shape and arrange in baking dish seam side down. Top evenly with remaining sauce, making certain that pasta is completely covered.

6. Cover manicotti with aluminum foil. Bake until bubbling, about 40 minutes, then remove foil. Remove manicotti and adjust oven rack to highest position (about 6 inches from heating element) and heat broiler. Sprinkle manicotti evenly with remaining 1 cup Parmesan. Broil until cheese is spotty brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Cool 15 minutes, then serve.

Yukon Gold, red, russet, or white potatoes can be used--each turns out a different texture. For smooth mashed potatoes, a food mill or potato ricer fitted with the finest disk is the best choice. For chunky mashed potatoes, use a potato masher and decrease the half-and-half to 3/4 cup.

Serves 4
2 	pounds potatoes , scrubbed
8 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted
1 	cup half-and-half , warmed
1 1/2 	teaspoons table salt 
	Ground black pepper 
	


1. Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with 1 inch water. Bring to boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender (a paring knife can be slipped into and out of center of potatoes with very little resistance), 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.

2. Set food mill or ricer over now empty but still warm saucepan. Spear potato with dinner fork, then peel back skin with paring knife. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Working in batches, cut peeled potatoes into rough chunks and drop into hopper of food mill or ricer. Process or rice potatoes into saucepan.

3. Stir in butter with wooden spoon until incorporated; gently whisk in half-and-half, salt, and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

Take care to cut the potatoes into evenly sized wedges so that all of the pieces will cook at about the same rate. Although it isn't required, a nonstick baking sheet works particularly well for this recipe. It not only keeps the fries from sticking to the pan but, because of its dark color, encourages deep and even browning. Whether you choose a nonstick baking sheet or a regular baking sheet, make sure that it is heavy duty. The intense heat of the oven may cause lighter pans to warp.

Serves 3 to 4
3 	russet potatoes (about 8 ounces each), peeled, each potato cut lengthwise into 10 to 12 evenly sized wedges
5 	tablespoons vegetable oil or peanut oil
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
	


1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position; heat oven to 475 degrees. Place potatoes in large bowl and cover with hot tap water; soak 10 minutes. Meanwhile, coat 18 by 12-inch heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet (see note) with 4 tablespoons oil and sprinkle evenly with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside.

2. Drain potatoes. Spread potatoes out on triple layer of paper towels and thoroughly pat dry with additional paper towels. Rinse and wipe out now-empty bowl; return potatoes to bowl and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Arrange potatoes in single layer on prepared baking sheet; cover tightly with foil and bake 5 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until bottoms of potatoes are spotty golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating baking sheet after 10 minutes. Using metal spatula and tongs, scrape to loosen potatoes from pan, then flip each wedge, keeping potatoes in single layer. Continue baking until fries are golden and crisp, 5 to 15 minutes longer, rotating pan as needed if fries are browning unevenly.

3. Transfer fries to second baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste and serve.

Steak Frites     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
Make sure to dry the potatoes well before tossing them with the cornstarch. For safety, use a Dutch oven with a capacity of at least 7 quarts. Use refined peanut oil (such as Planters) to fry the potatoes, not toasted peanut oil. A 12-inch skillet is essential for cooking four steaks at once. The recipe can be prepared through step 4 up to 2 hours in advance; turn off the heat under the oil, turning the heat back to medium when you start step 6. The ingredients can be halved to serve two-keep the oil amount the same and forgo blanching and frying the potatoes in batches. If you prefer not to fry, follow our recipe for Oven Fries, (see related recipe).
Serves 4
2 1/2 	pounds russet potatoes (about 4 large), scrubbed, sides squared off and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch fries (see illustration below)
2 	tablespoons cornstarch 
3 	quarts peanut oil 
1 	tablespoon vegetable oil 
2 	boneless strip or rib-eye steaks (1 pound each), cut in half (see photo below)
	Kosher salt and ground black pepper 

Herb Butter
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter , softened
1/2 	medium shallot , minced (about 2 tablespoons)
1 	clove garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
1 	tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves  
1 	tablespoon minced fresh chives 
1/4 	teaspoon table salt 
1/4 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
	
 


1. Rinse cut potatoes in large bowl under cold running water until water turns clear. Cover with cold water and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.

2. Pour off water, spread potatoes onto kitchen towels, and thoroughly dry. Transfer potatoes to large bowl and toss with cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer potatoes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest until fine white coating forms, about 20 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven fitted with clip-on-the-pot candy thermometer, heat peanut oil over medium heat to 325 degrees.

4. Add half of potatoes, a handful at a time, to hot oil and increase heat to high. Fry, stirring with mesh spider or large-hole slotted spoon, until potatoes start to turn from white to blond, 4 to 5 minutes. (Oil temperature will drop about 75 degrees during this frying.) Transfer fries to thick paper bag or paper towels. Return oil to 325 degrees and repeat with remaining potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and let fries cool while cooking steaks, at least 10 minutes.

5. Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Meanwhile, season steaks with salt and pepper. Lay steaks in pan, leaving 1/4 inch between them. Cook, not moving steaks, until well browned, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip steaks and continue to cook until instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 120 degrees for rare to medium-rare, 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer steaks to large plate, top with butter, and tent loosely with foil; let rest while finishing fries.

6. Increase heat under Dutch oven to high and heat oil to 375 degrees. Add half of fries, a handful at a time, and fry until golden brown and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to thick paper bag or paper towels. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining fries. Season fries with salt and serve immediately with steaks.

7. For Herbed Butter: Combine all ingredients in medium bowl.



STEP BY STEP: Squaring the Spud


The best way to uniformly cut fries is to start by trimming a thin slice from each side of the potato. Once the potato is "squared," you can slice it into 1/4-inch planks and then cut each plank into 1/4-inch fries.
STEP BY STEP: One Steak Becomes Two

In order to have four steaks that fit in a skillet at the same time, it is necessary to buy two 1-pound steaks and cut them in half according to their thickness. If your steaks are 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 inches thick, cut them in half vertically into small, thick steaks. If your steaks are thicker than 1 3/4 inches, cut them in half horizontally into two thinner steaks.

Thin Steak: Cut in half vertically. 	
Thick Steak: Cut in half horizontally.
STEP BY STEP: Recipe Shorthand: Steak Frites

Successful steak frites requires some careful timing. The first four steps can be completed up to 2 hours before dinner. Once you start cooking the steaks, you need to work quickly to get the steak and fries on the table.

1. Rinse cut potatoes. 	
2. Toss potatoes with cornstarch.

3. Air-dry potatoes. 	
4. Blanch potatoes, in two batches, in 325-degree oil; let cool.

5. Cook steaks. 	
6. Finish fries, in two batches, in 375-degree oil.
Salad with Roasted Beets, Fried Shallots, and Roquefort     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
We tried a half-dozen varieties of blue cheese and all were acceptable, but tasters favored rich, creamy Roquefort. If you prefer to use a very mild and mellow blue cheese, we recommend Danish blue; if you prefer a sharp and piquant one, try Stilton. Use paper towels to rub the skins from the cooked and cooled beets.
Serves 6 as a first course
12 	ounces beets (3 small or 2 medium), washed and trimmed of root tips and stems
3 	medium shallots , sliced thin and separated into rings (about 1 cup)
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
2 	tablespoons all-purpose flour 
6 	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
2 	tablespoons sherry vinegar 
2 	teaspoons honey 
1 	bunch arugula (large), washed, dried, trimmed of stems, and torn into bite-size pieces (about 6 cups)
1 	medium head butter lettuce , washed, dried, and torn into bite-size pieces (about 7 cups)
6 	ounces Roquefort cheese , crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups)
	
 


1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 400 degrees. Wrap each beet in foil and bake until paring knife can be inserted and removed with little resistance, 50 to 60 minutes. Unwrap beets; when cool enough to handle, peel and cut beets into 1/4-inch-thick wedges and place in medium bowl.

2. While beets are roasting, toss shallots with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and flour in medium bowl. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until smoking; add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and crisped, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shallots to plate lined with triple layer of paper towels.

3. Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons oil, vinegar, honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in small bowl until combined. Add 1 tablespoon vinaigrette to beets, season beets to taste with salt and pepper, and toss to combine.

4. Toss arugula, lettuce, and remaining vinaigrette in large bowl; adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Divide greens among individual plates; top each with portion of beets, fried shallots, and Roquefort. Serve immediately.



Dark Chocolate Mousse     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
When developing this recipe, we used our winning supermarket brand of dark chocolate, Ghirardelli bittersweet, which contains about 60 percent cacao. If you choose to make the mousse a day in advance, leave it out at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. Serve with very lightly sweetened whipped cream and chocolate shavings. A hand-held mixer can do the job of a standing mixer in this recipe, though mixing times may vary slightly.
Makes 3 1/2 cups (6 to 8 servings)
8 	ounces bittersweet chocolate , chopped fine
2 	tablespoons cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-processed)
1 	teaspoon instant espresso powder 
5 	tablespoons water 
1 	tablespoon brandy 
2 	large eggs , separated
1 	tablespoon sugar 
1/8 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	cup heavy cream , plus 2 additional tablespoons (chilled)
	
 


1. Melt chocolate, cocoa powder, espresso powder, water, and brandy in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat.

2. Whisk egg yolks, 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in medium bowl until mixture lightens in color and thickens slightly, about 30 seconds. Pour melted chocolate into egg mixture and whisk until combined. Let cool until just warmer than room temperature, 3 to 5 minutes.

3. In clean bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites at medium-low speed until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 1 minute. Detach whisk and bowl from mixer and whisk last few strokes by hand, making sure to scrape any unbeaten whites from bottom of bowl. Using whisk, stir about one-quarter of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it; gently fold in remaining egg whites with rubber spatula until a few white streaks remain.

4. In now-empty bowl, whip heavy cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 15 seconds more. Using rubber spatula, fold whipped cream into mousse until no white streaks remain. Spoon into 6 to 8 individual serving dishes or goblets. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set and firm, at least 2 hours. (The mousse may be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)



STEP BY STEP: Getting the Mousse Texture Right

There are as many different mousse textures as there are mousse recipes. Here's how some of them look.

DENSE: Butter, unwhipped cream, and too much chocolate are often the culprits in heavy, ganache-like mousse. 	
FLUFFY: Too many whipped egg whites produce an unappealing "marshmallow effect."

PERFECT: Going easy on the egg whites, omitting the butter, and adding a small amount of water yield just the right texture.

Homemade croutons are better than any you can buy and are a good use for stale bread. Cut a hunk of leftover baguette or country white bread into small cubes and fry them in olive oil until crisp. I prefer slightly woodsy cremini mushrooms in this salad, but regular white mushrooms are fine.

Serves 4
1 1/2 	pounds flat-leaf spinach , stemmed, washed, dried, and torn into large pieces (about 9 cups, tightly packed)
1/2 	pound cremini mushrooms or white mushrooms, cleaned, stems trimmed, sliced thin
1/2 	cup extra-virgin olive oil 
3 	cups stale French or Italian-style bread cut into 3/4-inch cubes
2 	medium cloves garlic , minced
1/4 	cup lemon juice from 2 medium lemons
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
	


1. Place spinach and mushrooms in large bowl; set aside.

2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bread; fry, turning several times with slotted spoon, until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Off heat, let remaining oil cool slightly, about 1 minute. Add garlic; cook until lightly colored, about 2 minutes. Whisk in lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Pour warm dressing over salad; toss. Add croutons; toss again. Serve immediately.

1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Trim outer leaves of cauliflower and cut stem flush with bottom. Cut head into 8 equal wedges so that core and florets remain intact (see illustration). Place wedges cut side down on foil- or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; gently rub to evenly distribute oil and seasonings. Gently flip cauliflower and season other cut side with 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and pepper.

2. Cover baking sheet tightly with foil and cook for 10 minutes. Remove foil and continue to roast until bottoms of cauliflower pieces are golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove sheet from oven, and, using spatula, carefully flip wedges. Return sheet to oven and continue to roast until cauliflower is golden all over, 8 to 12 minutes longer.

3. While cauliflower roasts, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in small skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and raisins; cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium and add water, vinegar, and honey. Simmer until lightly syrupy, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in parsley, almonds, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle sauce over roasted cauliflower and garnish with chives.

1. Mash bread and milk in large bowl with fork until homogeneous (you should have about 1/4 cup). Stir in salt, pepper, garlic, and steak sauce.

2. Break up beef into small pieces over bread mixture. Using fork or hands, lightly mix together until mixture forms cohesive mass. Divide meat into 4 equal portions. Gently toss 1 portion of meat back and forth between hands to form loose ball. Gently flatten into 3/4-inch-thick patty that measures about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Press center of patty down with fingertips until it is about 1/2 inch thick, creating slight depression in patty. Repeat with remaining portions of meat.

3. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until just beginning to smoke. Add meat patties, indentation side up, and cook until well-browned, about 5 minutes. Using wide spatula, flip burgers and continue cooking, about 4 minutes for medium-well or 5 minutes for well-done. Distribute equal portion of cheese (if using) on burgers about 2 minutes before they reach desired doneness, covering skillet with lid to melt cheese. While burgers cook, toast buns. Serve on buns with desired toppings.



Latino-Style Chicken and Rice with Breast Meat

Written: 1/2007
To keep the dish from becoming greasy, it is important to remove excess fat from the chicken breasts and trim the skin so it just covers the meat. This dish is best made using a Hispanic brand of medium-grain rice. Italian and Japanese brands have a tendency to make the dish too sticky. To use long-grain rice, increase the water to 3/4 cup and the salt added in step 3 to 1 teaspoon.

Serves 4 to 6
6 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)
	Table salt 
1/2 	teaspoon dried oregano 
1 	tablespoon distilled white vinegar plus 2 additional teaspoons
	Ground black pepper 
4 	whole bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), trimmed of excess skin and fat and cut in half crosswise
2 	tablespoons olive oil 
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
1 	small green bell pepper , stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine (about 3/4 cup)
1/4 	teaspoon hot red pepper flakes

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Place garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in large bowl; using rubber spatula, mix to make smooth paste. Add oregano, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to garlic-salt mixture; stir to combine. Place chicken in bowl with marinade. Coat chicken pieces evenly with marinade; set aside for 15 minutes.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, green pepper, and pepper flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, 4 to 8 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons cilantro; stir to combine. Push vegetables to sides of pot and increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken to clearing in center of pot, skin side down, in even layer. Cook, without moving chicken, until outer layer of meat becomes opaque, 2 to 4 minutes. (If chicken begins to brown, reduce heat to medium.) Using tongs, flip chicken and cook on second side until opaque, 2 to 4 minutes more. Add tomato sauce, broth, and water; stir to combine. Bring to simmer; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chicken registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer chicken to large plate, wrap tightly with foil, and set aside.

3. Add rice, olives, capers, and 3/4 teaspoon salt; stir well. Bring to simmer, cover, and place pot in oven. After 10 minutes, remove pot from oven and gently stir rice once from bottom up. Return pot to oven. After another 10 minutes, stir once more, adding 1/4 cup water if rice appears dry and bottom of pot is beginning to burn. Cover and return pot to oven; cook until rice has absorbed all liquid and is tender but still holds its shape, about 10 minutes longer.

4. Remove and discard skin from chicken. Using 2 spoons, pull meat off bones in large chunks. Place chicken, along with any accumulated juices, in large bowl and toss with remaining tablespoon olive oil, remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro, and pimentos; season with salt and pepper to taste. Place chicken on top of rice, cover, and let stand until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.



Basic Spice Rub for Beef and Lamb     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
To apply spice rubs, sprinkle over the food and then gently massage in the seasonings to make sure they adhere. As a general rule, use about 1 tablespoon of rub per portion of poultry or meat and 1 teaspoon of rub per portion of fish. Although rubs can be applied right before cooking, we’ve discovered that the flavor of the spices penetrates deeper into the food if given time.

Spicy Rub for Barbecue

Written: 11/2006
To apply spice rubs, sprinkle over the food and then gently massage in the seasonings to make sure they adhere. As a general rule, use about 1 tablespoon of rub per portion of poultry or meat. Although this rub can be applied right before cooking, we’ve discovered that the flavor of the spices penetrates deeper into the food if given time. Refrigerate rubbed meat for at least an hour to maximize the return (large cuts of meat can sit overnight for a spicier, more intense flavor).

Makes about 1 cup
4 	tablespoons sweet paprika 
2 	tablespoons chili powder 
2 	tablespoons ground cumin 
2 	tablespoons dark brown sugar 
2 	tablespoons table salt 
1 	tablespoon dried oregano 
1 	tablespoon granulated sugar 
1 	tablespoon ground black pepper 
1 	tablespoon ground white pepper

Multigrain Dinner Rolls
Add to Favorites   |   Shopping List   |    Printer Friendly

Written: 11/2006
Don't confuse 7-grain hot cereal mix with boxed, cold breakfast cereals that may also be labeled 7-grain. Our favorite brands of 7-grain mix are Bob's Red Mill and Arrowhead Mills. Leftover rolls can be wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for 3 days; wrapped with an additional layer of aluminum foil, the rolls can be frozen for up to one month. This recipe works for a 9 by 13-inch baking dish or two 9 by 9-inch baking dishes.

Makes 18 individual rolls
6 1/4 	ounces 7-grain hot cereal mix , 1 1/4 cups, (see note above)
20 	ounces boiling water (2 1/2 cups)
15 	ounces unbleached all-purpose flour (3 cups), plus extra for dusting work surface
7 1/2 	ounces whole wheat flour (1 1/2 cups)
4 	tablespoons honey 
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted and cooled slightly
2 1/2 	teaspoons instant yeast 
1 	tablespoon table salt 
3/4 	cup pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, (unsalted)
1/2 	cup old-fashioned rolled oats or quick oats
	
Some multigrain loaves are fluffy but flavorless, while others are delicious but dense. We wanted the best of both worlds.

1. Place cereal mix in bowl of standing mixer and pour boiling water over it; let stand, stirring occasionally, until mixture cools to 100 degrees and resembles thick porridge, about 1 hour. Whisk flours in medium bowl.

2. Once grain mixture has cooled, add honey, melted butter, and yeast and stir to combine. Attach bowl to standing mixer fitted with dough hook. With mixer running on low speed, add flours, 1/2 cup at a time, and knead until dough forms ball, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes; cover bowl with plastic and let dough rest 20 minutes. Add salt and knead on medium-low speed until dough clears sides of bowl, 3 to 4 minutes (if it does not clear sides, add 2 to 3 tablespoons additional all-purpose flour and continue mixing); continue to knead dough for 5 more minutes. Add seeds and knead for another 15 seconds. Transfer dough to floured work surface and knead by hand until seeds are dispersed evenly and dough forms smooth, taut ball. Place dough into greased container with 4-quart capacity; cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled, 45 to 60 minutes.

3. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Spray two 9 by 9-inch baking pans with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface and cut in half crosswise with knife or bench scraper. Cut each half into thirds, then into thirds again, to make 18 even sized pieces of dough. Gently roll each piece in circular motion to make round, then roll one side of dough in oats and place in baking pan, oat side up. Repeat to fill both baking pans with nine rolls each. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rise until almost doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. (Dough should barely spring back when poked with knuckle.) Bake until internal temperature registers 200 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove rolls from pans and cool on wire rack before serving, about 2 hours.



    
    
    


Baked Orange-Flavored Chicken
Add to Favorites   |   Shopping List   |    Printer Friendly

Written: 5/2006
We prefer the flavor and texture of thigh meat for this recipe, though an equal amount of boneless, skinless chicken breasts can be used. It is easiest to grate the orange zest and remove the strips of orange peel before juicing the oranges; use a sharp vegetable peeler to remove the strips. For extra spiciness, increase the cayenne added to the sauce to 1/2 teaspoon. The whole dried chiles are added for appearance, not for flavor, and can be omitted. White rice and steamed broccoli are good accompaniments.

Serves 4

Marinade and Sauce
1 1/2 	pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs , trimmed and cut in 1 1/2-inch pieces
3/4 	cup low-sodium chicken broth 
3/4 	cup orange juice , plus 1 1/2 teaspoons grated zest, and 8 strips orange peel (each about 2 inches long by 1/2 inch wide) from 2 oranges
6 	tablespoons distilled white vinegar 
1/4 	cup soy sauce 
1/2 	cup packed dark brown sugar (3 1/2 ounces)
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1 	piece fresh ginger (about 1 inch), grated (1 tablespoon)
1/4 	teaspoon cayenne pepper 
1 	tablespoon cornstarch , plus 2 teaspoons
2 	tablespoons water (cold)
8 	small whole dried red chiles (optional)

Coating and Frying Medium
3 	large egg whites 
1/2 	cup cornstarch 
1/2 	cup all-purpose flour 
1/2 	cups peanut oil 
	
Forget about takeout. Homemade orange chicken is much better.


1. FOR THE MARINADE AND SAUCE: Place chicken in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag; set aside. Combine chicken broth, orange juice, grated zest, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, ginger, and cayenne in large saucepan (with at least 3-quart capacity); whisk until sugar is fully dissolved. Measure out 3/4 cup mixture and pour into bag with chicken; press out as much air as possible and seal bag, making sure that all pieces are coated with marinade. Refrigerate at least 30 but no more than 60 minutes.

2. Bring remaining mixture to boil in saucepan over high heat. In small bowl, stir together cornstarch and cold water; whisk cornstarch mixture into sauce. Simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until thick and translucent, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in orange peel and chiles (sauce should measure 1 1/2 cups); set sauce aside.

3. FOR THE COATING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Place egg whites in pie plate; using fork, beat until frothy. In second pie plate, whisk cornstarch and flour until combined. Drain chicken in colander or large mesh strainer; thoroughly pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place chicken pieces in egg whites and turn to coat, then strain again until egg mixture has drained away; transfer pieces to cornstarch mixture and coat thoroughly, then gently pat to allow excess cornstarch mixture to fall off, leaving a thin layer. Place dredged chicken pieces on plate.

4. TO COOK THE CHICKEN: Heat rimmed baking sheet in oven for five minutes. Add oil and return baking sheet to oven until oil is just smoking, about 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces, evenly spaced in single layer, and cook 10 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven, turn chicken, and cook on second side until light brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to paper towel to drain excess oil.

5. TO SERVE: Reheat sauce over medium heat until simmering, about 2 minutes. Add chicken and gently toss until evenly coated and heated through. Serve immediately.

Makes enough to sauce 2 pork tenderloins
1 	teaspoon vegetable oil 
2 	teaspoons minced fresh ginger 
1/4 	cup hoisin sauce 
1/2 	cup fresh squeezed orange juice from 2 oranges
1/2 	cup low-sodium chicken broth 
1 	teaspoon toasted sesame oil 
2 	scallions , white and green parts sliced 1/8 inch thick on bias
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
	
Taking a cue from the more famous filet mignon, our "pork mignons" are thick-cut to keep them juicy and moist.


Pour off any fat from skillet in which pork was cooked. Add oil and heat skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add hoisin sauce, orange juice, broth, and any juices from resting meat and bring to simmer, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Simmer until liquid is reduced to 1 cup, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sesame oil and scallions. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper, pour sauce over pork, and serve immediately.

If Italian fontina is not available, use whole milk mozzarella rather than a rubbery Danish, Swedish, or American fontina. We like the mushroom sauce made with whole milk, but both skim and low-fat milk are acceptable.

Serves 10 to 12
1/2 	ounce dried porcini mushrooms , rinsed well
1 	cup water 
2 	pounds portobello mushroom caps (about 10 medium), cleaned and cut into 2- to 3-inch by 1/4-inch slices

1. Cover porcinis with water in small microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic wrap, cut several steam vents in plastic with paring knife, and microwave on high power for 30 seconds. Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes. Lift mushrooms from liquid with fork and roughly chop (you should have about 3 tablespoons). Strain liquid through fine-mesh strainer lined with paper towel into medium bowl. Set mushrooms and liquid aside.

2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Spread portobello mushrooms in even layer on rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil, tossing to coat mushrooms evenly; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss again. Roast mushrooms until shriveled and all liquid released from mushrooms has evaporated, about 30 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking time. Set mushrooms aside to cool.

3. While portobellos roast, heat 1 tablespoon oil and pancetta in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until pancetta is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to large bowl; pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat. Add onions, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are browned around edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer onions to large bowl with pancetta and set aside.

4. Meanwhile, process button mushrooms in food processor until uniformly coarsely chopped, about six 1-second pulses, stopping to scrape down bowl as needed. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chopped button mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and all moisture has evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes.

5. Reduce heat to medium and stir in porcini mushrooms, 1 tablespoon garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vermouth and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.

6. Add butter and cook until melted. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Slowly add reserved porcini soaking liquid, scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits. Add milk and nutmeg. Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has thickened and reached consistency of heavy cream, 10 to 15 minutes (you should have about 4 cups). Remove from heat and stir in 2 tablespoons parsley and sage.

7. Combine fontina and Parmesan in medium bowl. Toss cooled portobello mushrooms with onions in large bowl. Place noodles in 13 by 9-inch ovensafe baking dish and cover with hot tap water; let soak 5 minutes, agitating noodles occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water and place in single layer on kitchen towel. Wipe baking dish dry and coat with butter.

8. Using rubber spatula, evenly distribute 1 cup mushroom sauce in bottom of baking dish; position 3 noodles on top of sauce. Spread 3/4 cup sauce evenly over noodles followed by 2 cups mushroom-onion mixture and 3/4 cup cheese. Repeat layering of noodles, sauce, mushroom-onion mixture, and cheese two more times. Place 3 remaining noodles on top of last layer of cheese. Spread remaining sauce over noodles and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Lightly spray large sheet of foil with nonstick cooking spray and cover lasagna. Bake until bubbling, about 20 minutes.

9. While lasagna is baking, combine remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and 1 teaspoon garlic with basil and lemon zest in small bowl. Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees, remove foil from lasagna, and continue to bake until cheese on top becomes spotty brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove lasagna from oven and sprinkle evenly with herb mixture. Cool 15 minutes, then cut into pieces and serve.

To keep the dish from becoming greasy, it is important to remove excess fat from the chicken thighs and trim the skin so it just covers each thigh. This dish is best made using a Hispanic brand of medium-grain rice. Italian and Japanese brands have a tendency to make the dish too sticky. To use long-grain rice, increase the water to 3/4 cup and the salt added in step 3 to 1 teaspoon.

Serves 4 to 6
6 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 6 teaspoons)
	Table salt 
1 	tablespoon ground cumin 
1 	tablespoon distilled white vinegar plus 2 additional teaspoons
	Ground black pepper 
8 	bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), trimmed of excess skin and fat
2 	tablespoons olive oil 
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
1 	small green bell pepper , stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine (about 3/4 cup)
8 	ounces ham steak or Canadian bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)
1/4 	teaspoon hot red pepper flakes 
1/4 	cup minced fresh cilantro leaves 
	1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce 
1 3/4 	cups low-sodium chicken broth 
	Water 
3 	cups medium-grain rice (see note above)
1/2 	cup green olives (manzanilla), pitted and halved

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Place garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in large bowl; using rubber spatula, mix to make smooth paste. Add cumin, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to garlic-salt mixture; stir to combine. Place chicken in bowl with marinade. Using fingers, coat chicken pieces evenly with marinade; set aside for 15 minutes.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, green pepper, ham, and pepper flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, 4 to 8 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons cilantro; stir to combine. Push vegetables to sides of pot and increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken to clearing in center of pot, skin side down, in even layer. Cook, without moving chicken, until outer layer of meat becomes opaque, 2 to 4 minutes. (If chicken begins to brown, reduce heat to medium). Using tongs, flip chicken and cook on second side until opaque, 2 to 4 minutes more. Add tomato sauce, broth, and 1/4 cup water; stir gently to combine. Bring to simmer; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes (chicken will not be fully cooked).

3. Add rice, olives, capers, orange zest, and 3/4 teaspoon salt; stir well. Bring to simmer, cover, and place pot in oven. After 10 minutes, remove pot from oven and gently stir chicken and rice once from bottom up. After another 10 minutes, stir once more, adding peas and 1/4 cup water if rice appears dry and bottom of pot is beginning to burn. Cover and return pot to oven; cook until rice has absorbed all liquid and is tender but still holds its shape and temperature of chicken registers 175 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes longer.

4. Using tongs, remove chicken from pot; replace lid and set pot aside. Remove and discard chicken skin; using 2 spoons, pull meat off bones into large chunks. Using fingers, remove remaining fat or dark veins from chicken pieces. Place chicken in large bowl and toss with remaining tablespoon olive oil, remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro, pimentos, and orange juice; season with salt and pepper to taste. Place chicken on top of rice, cover, and let stand until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve, passing lemon wedges at table.




Individual Blueberry Buckles

Written: 9/2006
A blueberry buckle is a blueberry coffeecake with a streusel topping. The batter will be extremely thick and heavy, and some effort will be required to spread it into individual muffin papers. These individual buckles are best made with fresh blueberries, not frozen ones, which are too moist. If you'd like to serve these as dessert, consider vanilla ice cream or whipped cream as an accompaniment. Leftovers can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

Makes 12 individual servings

Streusel
1/2 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour (2 1/2 ounces)
1/2 	cup packed light brown sugar (3 1/2 ounces)
2 	tablespoons granulated sugar 
1/4 	teaspoon ground cinnamon 
	Pinch table salt 
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cut into 8 pieces, softened but still cool

Cakes
1 1/2 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour ( 7 1/2 ounces)
1 1/2 	teaspoons baking powder 
10 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/4 stick), softened but still cool
2/3 	cup granulated sugar (about 4 3/4 ounces)
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2 	teaspoon grated lemon zest 
1 1/2 	teaspoons vanilla extract 
2 	large eggs , room temperature
4 	cups fresh blueberries (about 20 ounces), picked over
	
A buckle is a yellow cake loaded with berries and crowned with crisp and crumbly streusel.

1. For the streusel: In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, combine flour, sugars, cinnamon, and salt on low speed until well combined and no large brown sugar lumps remain, about 45 seconds. Add butter and mix on low until mixture resembles wet sand and no large butter pieces remain, about 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer streusel to small bowl and set aside.

2. For the cakes: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Line muffin pan with paper liners.

3. Whisk flour and baking powder in small bowl to combine; set aside. In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, cream butter, sugar, salt, and lemon zest at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes; using rubber spatula, scrape down bowl. Beat in vanilla until combined, about 30 seconds. With mixer running at medium speed, add eggs one at a time; beat until partially incorporated, then scrape down bowl and continue to beat until fully incorporated (mixture will appear broken). With mixer running on low speed, gradually add flour mixture; beat until flour is almost fully incorporated, about 20 seconds. Disengage bowl from mixer; stir batter with rubber spatula, scraping bottom and sides of bowl, until no flour pockets remain and batter is homogenous; batter will be very heavy and thick. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in blueberries until evenly distributed.

4. Transfer batter to prepared muffin cups; with spoon, spread batter evenly to cup edges, gently pushing in to fill all gaps, and smooth surface. (Note: Batter will come up to top of papers.) Squeeze handful of streusel in hand to form large cohesive clump; break up clump with fingers and sprinkle streusel evenly over batter. Repeat with remaining streusel. Bake until deep golden brown and toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool until just warm or to room temperature, about 1 hour.

We prefer to use gyoza wrappers. You can substitute wonton wrappers, but the cooking time and recipe yield will vary. Potstickers are best served hot from the skillet; we recommend that you serve the first batch immediately, then cook the second batch. To freeze potstickers, place filled, uncooked dumplings in the freezer in a single layer on a plate until frozen, then transfer to a storage bag. There's no need to thaw frozen potstickers; just proceed with the recipe.

Makes 24 dumplings, 6 first-course servings

Filling
3 	cups minced napa cabbage leaves 
3/4 	teaspoon table salt 
3/4 	pound peeled, deveined shrimp , pulsed ten times in food processor
6 	tablespoons minced scallions (about 4 medium scallions, white and green parts)
1/8 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
4 	teaspoons soy sauce 
1 1/2 	teaspoons grated fresh ginger 
1 	medium clove garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
1 	egg , lightly beaten


24 	gyoza wrappers , round, (see note above)
4 	teaspoons vegetable oil 
	
A sequence of searing, steaming, then cranking up the heat produces potstickers with a pleasing balance of soft and crispy textures.

1. Toss cabbage and salt in colander or mesh strainer set over medium bowl. Let stand until cabbage begins to wilt, about 20 minutes; press cabbage gently with rubber spatula to squeeze out excess moisture. Combine cabbage and all other filling ingredients in medium bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until mixture is cold, at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.

2. Place 4 wrappers flat on work surface (keep remaining wrappers covered with plastic wrap). Following illustration 1, above, place one slightly rounded tablespoon filling in center of each wrapper. Using pastry brush or fingertip, moisten edge of wrapper with water. Fold each wrapper in half; starting in center and working toward outside edges, pinch edges together firmly to seal, pressing out any air pockets (illustrations 2 and 3). Position each dumpling on its side and gently flatten, pressing down on seam to make sure it lies flat against work surface (illustration 4). Repeat to form 24 dumplings. (Filled dumplings can be refrigerated overnight in single layer on baking sheet wrapped tightly with plastic wrap.)

3. Add 2 teaspoons oil to 12-inch nonstick skillet and quickly spread oil with paper towel to distribute evenly. Arrange 12 dumplings in skillet, lying flat on one side, with all seams facing same direction, overlapping just slightly, if necessary. Place skillet over medium-high heat and cook, without moving, until dumplings are golden brown on bottoms, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add 1/2 cup water to skillet, and cover immediately. Cook, covered, until most of water is absorbed and wrappers are slightly translucent, about 10 minutes. Uncover skillet and increase heat to medium-high; cook, without stirring, until dumpling bottoms are well browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes more. Turn off burner and slide dumplings from skillet onto double layer paper towels, browned side down, to blot excess oil. Transfer to platter and serve immediately with Scallion Dipping Sauce (see related recipe). Let skillet cool until just warm, then wipe skillet clean and repeat with remaining dumplings and oil.

Choosing the Right Wrap
Tasters preferred the slightly chewy texture of gyoza-style wrappers to thinner wonton wrappers, but both styles produced terrific potstickers. Although we developed our recipe using round wrappers, square or rectangular wrappers can be used as well. Here's how to adjust filling amount and steaming time. Because the smaller wrappers yield more dumplings, you'll need to cook them in multiple batches. (For wrapping instructions, see instructions below.)

WRAPPER
Round gyoza (3 3/4 inches diameter), fill with 1 rounded tablespoon, steam for 10 minutes
Round wonton (3 3/4 inches diameter), fill with 1 rounded tablespoon, steam for 6 minutes
Square wonton (3 3/8 inches square), fill with 2 rounded teaspoons, steam for 6 minutes
Rectangular wonton (3 1/4 inches by 2 3/4 inches), fill with 1 rounded teaspoon, steam for 5 minutes




Tea-Smoked Duck
Add to Favorites   |   Shopping List   |    Printer Friendly

Written: 9/2006
To make this recipe, you will need a baking stone, a sturdy baking sheet with a 1-inch rim, and a wire cooling rack that fits inside it. Be sure to line baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. Be careful when opening the crimped foil to add the juice, as hot steam and smoke will billow out. We recommend serving this smoked duck shredded atop a main-course salad.

Serves 2 as a main course or 4 as a first course

Rub
6 	tablespoons mustard (yellow)
2 	tablespoons ketchup 
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
2 	teaspoons ground black pepper 
1 	tablespoon sweet paprika 
1 	tablespoon chili powder 
1/2 	teaspoon cayenne pepper 
1 1/2 	tablespoons kosher salt 
3 	tablespoons brown sugar 

Duck
1 	whole duckling (about 6 pounds), quartered, with backbone removed, and all excess fat and skin trimmed
1/2 	cup Lapsang Souchong tea leaves (loose or from about 10 tea bags), ground to powder in spice grinder (about 1/4 cup powder)
1/2 	cup apple juice 
	


Pork 
See Illustrations Below: Homemade Indoor Smoker

1. Combine mustard, ketchup, and garlic in small bowl; combine remaining rub ingredients in separate small bowl. Spread mustard mixture in thin, even layer all over inside and outside of duck, then coat all over with spice mixture. Wrap duck in plastic and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 48 hours.

2. Using tip of paring knife or sharp scissors, cut many nicks in skin over entire body of duck. Set V-rack inside large roasting pan. Place duck quarters, skin side up, on rack. Place roasting pan over 2 burners and add enough water to come just below bottom of duck. Bring water to boil over high heat, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and adjust heat to medium. Steam, adding more hot water to maintain water level, if necessary, until fat beads on pores of duck and bird is partially cooked, 30 minutes. Lift duck from rack, use paper towels to pat skin gently (so as not to break it) to remove excess fat and moisture.

3. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and place baking stone on lower rack; heat oven to 500 degrees. Sprinkle ground tea evenly over bottom of foil-lined rimmed baking sheet; set wire rack on sheet. Place duck pieces skin side up on rack and cover with heavy-duty foil, crimping edges tightly to seal. Roast duck directly on stone for 10 minutes, then carefully open one corner of foil and pour apple juice into bottom of baking sheet, remove breast pieces to cutting board, and reseal foil. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees, leaving oven door open for 1 minute to cool. Continue to roast until meat is very tender and begins to pull away from bones, about 45 minutes.

4. Remove foil carefully. Turn on broiler; transfer all pieces (including breasts) to baking sheet, and place on lower oven rack. Cook until well browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool for at least 20 minutes before carving. Serve with barbecue sauce, if desired.

Use either the charcoal-grilled shrimp skewer option or the gas-grilled shrimp skewer option listed below with the sauce.

Fresh Tomato Sauce with Feta and Olives for Grilled Shrimp Skewers     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
This recipe is designed to accompany either Charcoal-or Gas-Grilled Shrimp Skewers, (see related recipes).
Makes enough to sauce 1 1/2 pounds shrimp.
	Disposable 10-inch aluminum pie plate 
4 	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
1 	large ripe tomato , cored, seeded, and diced very small
1/8 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	tablespoon minced fresh oregano leaves  
2 	tablespoons fresh lemon juice from 1 lemon
4 	ounces feta cheese (about 1 cup), crumbled into 1/4-inch pieces
1/3 	cup kalamata olives , pitted and chopped fine
3 	scallion , white and green parts sliced very thin
	
 


1. Combine oil, tomato, salt, and oregano in pie plate. Set aluminum pie plate with sauce over hot side of grill and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot (about 1 1/2 minutes); transfer to cool side of the grill if using a charcoal grill or set aside off heat if using a gas grill.

2. Proceed to grill shrimp as directed, adding lemon juice, feta, olives, and scallions just before serving.



Charcoal-Grilled Shrimp Skewers     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
The shrimp and sauce (see related recipes) finish cooking together on the grill, so prepare the sauce ingredients while the coals are heating, then carry them out to the grill with you. To fit all of the shrimp on the cooking grate at once, you’ll need three 14-inch metal skewers. (Wooden skewers will likely burn.) Serve with grilled crusty bread brushed with olive oil as an appetizer; add rice salad or couscous for a main course.
Serves 4 as a main course, 6 as an appetizer
1 1/2 	pounds extra-large shrimp (21/25), peeled and deveined, tails left on
2 - 3 	tablespoons olive oil for brushing skewers
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
1/4 	teaspoon sugar 
1 	recipe Spicy Lemon-Garlic Sauce, Charmoula Sauce, or Fresh Tomato Sauce with Feta and Olives
	Lemon wedges for serving
	
 


1. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Thread shrimp onto 3 skewers, alternating direction of heads and tails. Brush both sides of shrimp with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle one side of each skewer with sugar.

2. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 quarts, or about 100 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build modified two-level fire by arranging coals to cover one-half of grill, piling them about 3 briquettes high, leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush.

3. Set disposable aluminum pie plate with sauce ingredients over hot side of grill and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 1 1/2 minutes; transfer plate to cooler side of grill. Place shrimp skewers, sugared sides down, on hot side of grate; use tongs to push shrimp together on skewer if they have separated. Grill shrimp, uncovered, until lightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, flip and grill until second side is pink and slightly translucent, 1 to 2 minutes longer.

4. Using potholder or oven mitt, carefully lift each skewer from grill; use tongs to slide shrimp off skewers into pie plate with sauce. Toss shrimp and sauce to combine and transfer pie plate to hot side of grill; cook, stirring, until shrimp are opaque and fully cooked, about 30 seconds. Remove from grill, add remaining sauce ingredients and toss to combine. Transfer to serving platter and serve immediately with lemon wedges.



	Zucchini with Creamy Peas and Herbs
Add to Favorites   |   Shopping List   |    Printer Friendly

Written: 7/2006


Serves 4 as a side dish
5 	medium zucchini (about 8 ounces each), ends trimmed
	Table salt 
1 	tablespoon vegetable oil , plus 1 additional teaspoon
1 	bunch scallions , white parts chopped fine, green parts sliced thin
1 	cup frozen peas , thawed
1/2 	cup heavy cream 
2 	tablespoons chopped fresh dill leaves or mint
	Ground black pepper 
	Lemon wedges , for serving
	
Grating zucchini is the best method for getting the water out, clearing the way for maximum flavor.


1. Cut each zucchini crosswise into several pieces, each 2 to 3 inches long. Shred each piece on large holes of box grater, rotating as needed to avoid shredding seeds and core; you should have about 10 cups shredded zucchini. Toss zucchini with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and place in colander set in medium bowl; let drain 5 to 10 minutes. Wrap zucchini in kitchen towel, in batches if necessary, and wring out excess moisture.

2. Place zucchini in medium bowl and break up any large clumps. Drizzle 2 teaspoons oil over zucchini and toss to combine thoroughly.

3. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add white parts of scallions and cook, stirring, until softened and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high; add zucchini and spread evenly in pan with tongs; cook until bottom layer browns, about 2 minutes; stir well, breaking up any clumps with tongs, then cook until "new" bottom layer browns, about 2 minutes more. Add peas and cream and cook, stirring, until cream is mostly reduced, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in dill and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to platter and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

Well-Done Bacon Cheeseburgers on a Charcoal Grill     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
Adding a panade (a paste of bread and milk paste) to the ground beef creates burgers that are juicy and tender even when well-done. For a burger that cooks up flat, press the center of each patty down with your fingertips before grilling. Serve the burgers on your favorite buns or rolls.
Serves 4
8 	strips bacon (about 1/2 pound)
1 	large slice high-quality white sandwich bread , crust removed and discarded, bread chopped into 1/4-inch pieces (about 1/2 cup)
2 	tablespoons whole milk 
3/4 	teaspoon table salt 
3/4 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
1 	medium clove garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
2 	teaspoons steak sauce , such as A-1
1 1/2 	pounds 80 percent lean ground chuck 
	Vegetable oil for cooking grate
6 	ounces cheese , sliced, American or cheddar
4 	hamburger buns or rolls
	
 


1. Cook bacon in medium skillet over medium heat until crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper-towel-lined plate; set aside. Measure 2 tablespoons bacon fat into heatproof bowl; refrigerate until just warm.

2. Using large chimney starter, ignite 6 quarts charcoal (about 100 briquettes) and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build modified two-level fire by arranging coals to cover half of grill. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate for 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Grill is ready when coals are medium-hot (you can hold your hand 2 inches above grate for 3 to 4 seconds).

3. Meanwhile, mash bread and milk in large bowl with fork until homogeneous (you should have about 1/4 cup). Stir in salt, pepper, garlic, steak sauce, and reserved bacon fat; mix until thoroughly blended.

4. Break up beef into small pieces over bread mixture. Using fork or hands, lightly mix together until mixture forms cohesive mass. Divide meat into 4 equal portions. Gently toss one portion of meat back and forth between hands to form loose ball. Gently flatten into 3/4-inch-thick patty that measures about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Press center of patty down with fingertips until it is about 1/2 inch thick, creating a slight depression in each patty. Repeat with remaining portions of meat.

5. Lightly dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate. Grill burgers on hot side of grill, uncovered, until well seared on first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, flip burgers and continue grilling, about 3 minutes for medium-well or 4 minutes for well-done. Distribute equal portions of cheese on burgers about 2 minutes before they reach desired doneness, covering burgers with disposable aluminum pan to melt cheese. While burgers grill, toast buns on cooler side of grill, rotating buns as necessary to toast evenly. Serve burgers on toasted buns, topping each burger with 2 strips bacon.

Beans, Rice, and Grains  Chicken  Fish and Seafood  Spanish 
See Illustrations Below: Deveining Shrimp

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Toss shrimp, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1 teaspoon garlic in medium bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; set aside.

2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until skin begins to blister and turn spotty black, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer peppers to small plate and set aside.

3. Add 1 teaspoon oil to now-empty Dutch oven; heat oil until shimmering but not smoking. Add chicken pieces in single layer; cook, without moving pieces, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn pieces and brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer; transfer chicken to medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium and add chorizo to pot; cook, stirring frequently, until deeply browned and fat begins to render, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chorizo to bowl with chicken and set aside.

4. Add enough oil to fat in Dutch oven to equal 2 tablespoons; heat over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes; stir in remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes; cook until mixture begins to darken and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice and cook until grains are well coated with tomato mixture, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, wine, saffron, bay, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally.

5. Cover pot and transfer to oven; cook until rice absorbs most of liquid, about 30 minutes. Remove pot from oven; add chicken and chorizo, cover pot, and transfer to oven; cook for 15 minutes. Remove pot from oven; scatter shrimp over meat and rice, insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright), arrange bell pepper strips in pinwheel pattern, and scatter peas over top. Cover and return to oven; cook until shrimp are opaque and mussels have opened, about 12 minutes.

6. Let paella stand, covered, about 5 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened and bay leaf, if it can be easily removed. Sprinkle with parsley and serve, passing lemon wedges separately.




German Chocolate Sheet Cake
Add to Favorites   |   Shopping List   |    Printer Friendly

Written: 7/2006
When you frost the cake, the frosting should be cool or cold (or room temperature, at the very warmest). To be time-efficient, first make the frosting, then use the refrigeration time to prepare, bake, and cool the cake. The toasted pecans are stirred into the frosting just before the cake is frosted to keep them from becoming soft and soggy.

Serves 12 to 16

Frosting
4 	egg yolks 
1 	can evaporated milk (12 ounces)
1 	cup granulated sugar (7 ounces)
1/4 	cup packed light brown sugar (1 3/4 ounces)
6 	tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick), cut into 6 pieces
1/8 	teaspoon table salt 
2 	teaspoons vanilla extract 
2 1/3 	cups sweetened shredded coconut (7 ounces)
1 1/2 	cups finely chopped pecans (6 1/2 ounces), toasted on baking sheet in 350-degree oven until fragrant and browned, about 8 minutes

Cake
4 	ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate , chopped fine
1/4 	cup Dutch-processed cocoa , sifted
1/2 	cup boiling water 
2 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (10 ounces), plus additional for dusting pan
3/4 	teaspoon baking soda 
12 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened
1 	cup granulated sugar (7 ounces)
2/3 	cup packed light brown sugar (about 4 3/4 ounces)
3/4 	teaspoon table salt 
4 	large eggs , room temperature
1 	teaspoon vanilla extract 
3/4 	cup sour cream , room temperature
	


1. FOR THE FROSTING: Whisk yolks in medium saucepan; gradually whisk in evaporated milk. Add sugars, butter, and salt and cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until mixture is boiling, frothy, and slightly thickened, about 6 minutes. Transfer mixture to bowl, whisk in vanilla, then stir in coconut. Cool until just warm, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cool or cold, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. (Pecans are stirred in just before cake assembly.)

2. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine chocolate and cocoa in small bowl; pour boiling water over and let stand to melt chocolate, about 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth; set aside until cooled to room temperature.

3. Meanwhile, spray 13 by 9-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment or waxed paper and spray. Dust pan with flour, and knock out excess. Sift flour and baking soda into medium bowl or onto sheet of parchment or waxed paper.

4. In bowl of standing mixer, beat butter, sugars, and salt at medium-low speed until sugar is moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl with rubber spatula halfway through. With mixer running at medium speed, add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down bowl halfway through. Beat in vanilla; increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 45 seconds. With mixer running at low speed, add chocolate, then increase speed to medium and beat until combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl once (batter may appear broken). With mixer running at low speed, add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with sour cream (in 2 additions), beginning and ending with dry ingredients, and beating in each addition until barely combined. After final flour addition, beat on low until just combined, then stir batter by hand with rubber spatula, scraping bottom and sides of bowl to ensure that batter is homogenous (batter will be thick). Pour into prepared pan and level with rubber spatula.

5. Bake cake until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes, then invert cake onto greased wire rack; peel off and discard paper. Cool cake to room temperature before frosting, about 2 hours. (Cooled cake can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 1 day.)

6. To Frost the Cake: Stir toasted pecans into chilled frosting. Invert cake onto serving platter. Using spoon, place dollops of frosting evenly spaced over cake. Using icing spatula, spread frosting evenly over surface of cake. Cut into squares and serve. (Cover leftovers and refrigerate for up to 3 days. If refrigerated longer than 2 hours, let cake stand at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes before serving.)





Barbecued Pulled Chicken For Charcoal Grill with Peach Sauce     Add to Favorites     Shopping List  
Chicken leg quarters consist of drumsticks attached to thighs; often also attached are backbone sections that must be trimmed away. Supermarkets may also sell chicken legs, which are chicken leg quarters with the backbone sections already removed; they require less trimming and may weigh less than leg quarters. When trimming the fat from the chicken legs, try to leave the excess skin intact, as it will keep the meat moist on the grill. For equipment, you will need four 3-inch wood chunks (we like hickory or mesquite) and a 16 by 12-inch disposable aluminum roasting pan to catch the fat as the chicken cooks. Serve the pulled chicken with hamburger rolls or sandwich bread, pickles, and coleslaw. If you don't have peach preserves, apricot preserves also work well in the sauce.
Serves 6 to 8

Chicken
8 	bone-in, skin-on chicken leg quarters (about 7 pounds total), trimmed of backbone (see illustrations below) and excess fat
	Table salt and ground black pepper 

Sauce
1 	large onion , peeled and quartered
1 1/4 	cups water 
1 1/2 	cups ketchup 
3 	tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
3 	tablespoons Dijon mustard 
3/4 	cup peach preserves 
1/2 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
4 	tablespoons cider vinegar 
1 	tablespoon vegetable oil 
2 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
2 	teaspoons chili powder 
1/2 	teaspoon cayenne pepper 
	hot pepper sauce , such as Tabasco
	
 


1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Soak four 3-inch wood chunks in cold water to cover for 1 hour; drain.

2. Using large chimney starter, ignite about 4 1/2 quarts charcoal, or about 80 individual briquettes, and burn until fully ignited, about 15 minutes. Empty coals into grill; divide coals in half, creating piles on opposite sides of grill. Place 16 by 12-inch disposable aluminum roasting pan in center, between coal piles. Nestle two soaked wood chunks on top of one pile (reserve remaining wood chunks). Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush.

3. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of chicken legs with salt and pepper. Place chicken legs skin side up in single layer on center of grill over roasting pan. Cover and cook 30 minutes (internal grill temperature should register about 325 degrees after 30 minutes).

4. Working quickly to prevent excess heat loss, remove cover, and, using tongs, rotate each leg so that side facing inward now faces coals; do not flip chicken pieces. Add remaining wood chunks to either pile of coals; cover and cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thighs registers about 185 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes longer (internal grill temperature should register about 310 degrees). Transfer chicken to cutting board; let rest until cool enough to handle.

5. FOR THE SAUCE:While chicken is cooking or cooling, process onion and water in food processor fitted with steel blade until pureed and mixture resembles slush, about 30 seconds. Pass mixture through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids with rubber spatula; you should have 1/2 cup strained onion juice. Discard solids in strainer.

6. Whisk onion juice, ketchup, water, Worcestershire, mustard, preserves, pepper, and 3 tablespoons cider vinegar together in medium bowl. Heat oil in large nonreactive saucepan over medium heat until shimmering; add garlic, chili powder, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ketchup mixture; increase heat to medium-high, bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, until flavors meld and sauce is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. You should have scant 4 cups sauce. Transfer about 2 cups sauce to serving bowl; leave remaining sauce in saucepan.

7. Remove and discard skin from chicken legs. Using fingers, pull meat off bones, separating larger pieces (which should fall off bones easily) from smaller, drier pieces into two equal piles.

8. Place smaller chicken pieces in food processor and pulse until just coarsely chopped, three to four 1-second pulses, stirring chicken with rubber spatula after each pulse. Transfer chicken to sauce in saucepan. Using fingers or two forks, pull larger chicken pieces into long shreds and add to saucepan. Stir in remaining tablespoon cider vinegar; cover saucepan and heat chicken over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add hot sauce to taste and serve, passing remaining barbecue sauce separately.

9. BARBECUED PULLED CHICKEN FOR A CROWD: This technique works well on a charcoal grill but not so well on a gas grill.

10. Follow above recipe, igniting 6 quarts charcoal briquettes, using 12 chicken legs, and slotting them into V-shaped roasting rack set on top of cooking grate over disposable roasting pan (thigh end down, two legs in each slot -- see photo here). Increase cooking time in step 3 to 45 minutes and cooking time in step 4 to 45 to 55 minutes. In step 6, remove only 1 cup of sauce from saucepan. In step 8, process chicken in food processor in 2 batches.



STEP BY STEP: Trimming Leg Quarters


1. Carefully grasp leg and bend backbone section to pop joint. 	
2. Using a sharp boning knife, cut backbone section from leg.

3. Trim away any large pockets of fat.

Chicken leg quarters consist of drumsticks attached to thighs; often also attached are backbone sections that must be trimmed away. Supermarkets may also sell chicken legs, which are chicken leg quarters with the backbone sections already removed; they require less trimming and may weigh less than leg quarters. When trimming the fat from the chicken legs, try to leave the excess skin intact, as it will keep the meat moist on the grill. For equipment, you will need two cups wood chips (we like hickory or mesquite) and a 16 by 12-inch disposable aluminum roasting pan to catch the fat as the chicken cooks. If you would like to hold the dish once the chicken and sauce are combined and heated through, transfer the mixture to a 13 by 9-inch glass baking dish, cover with foil, and place in a 250-degree oven for up to an hour. Serve the pulled chicken with hamburger rolls or sandwich bread, pickles, and coleslaw.
Serves 6 to 8

Chicken
8 	bone-in, skin-on chicken leg quarters (about 7 pounds total), trimmed of backbone (see illustrations below) and excess fat

1 1/4 	cups water 
1 1/2 	cups ketchup 
3 	tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
3 	tablespoons Dijon mustard 
3/4 	cup peach preserves 
1/2 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
4 	tablespoons cider vinegar 
1 	tablespoon vegetable oil

2 	teaspoons chili powder 
1/2 	teaspoon cayenne pepper 
	hot pepper sauce , such as Tabasco
	
 


1. Soak 2 cups wood chips in water to cover for 30 minutes; drain. Place chips in small disposable aluminum pan; set pan on primary burner (burner that will remain on during barbecuing); position cooking grate. Ignite grill, turn all burners to high, cover, and heat until very hot and chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. (If chips ignite, use water-filled spray bottle to extinguish.) Scrape grate clean with grill brush. Turn off all burners except primary burner.

2. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of chicken legs with salt and pepper. Place chicken legs skin side up in single layer on cool side of grill. Cover and cook 35 minutes (internal grill temperature should register about 325 degrees after 30 minutes).

3. Working quickly to prevent excess heat loss, remove cover, and, using tongs, rotate each leg so that side formerly facing burner now faces away (do not flip chicken): cover and cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thighs registers about 185 degrees, 35 to 45 minutes longer (internal grill temperature should register about 310 degrees). Transfer chicken to cutting board; let rest until cool enough to handle.

4. FOR THE SAUCE: While chicken is cooking or cooling, process onion and water in food processor fitted with steel blade until pureed and mixture resembles slush, about 30 seconds. Pass mixture through fine-mesh strainer into liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids with rubber spatula; you should have 3/4 cup strained onion puree. Discard solids in strainer.

5. Whisk onion juice, ketchup, water, Worcestershire, mustard, preserves, pepper, and 3 tablespoons cider vinegar together in medium bowl. Heat oil in large nonreactive saucepan over medium heat until shimmering; add garlic, chili powder, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ketchup mixture; increase heat to medium-high, bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, until flavors meld and sauce is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. You should have scant 4 cups sauce. Transfer about 2 cups sauce to serving bowl; leave remaining sauce in saucepan.

6. Remove and discard skin from chicken legs. Using fingers, pull meat off bones, separating larger pieces (which should fall off bones easily) from smaller, drier pieces into two equal piles.

7. Place smaller chicken pieces in food processor and pulse until just coarsely chopped, three to four 1-second pulses, stirring chicken with rubber spatula after each pulse. Transfer chicken to sauce in saucepan. Using fingers or two forks, pull larger chicken pieces into long shreds and add to saucepan. Stir in remaining tablespoon cider vinegar; cover saucepan and heat chicken over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add hot sauce to taste and serve, passing remaining barbecue sauce separately.
