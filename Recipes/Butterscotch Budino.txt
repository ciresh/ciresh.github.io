Butterscotch Budino

1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup milk
 
1 large egg
2 large egg yolks
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon white rum

Directions

Combine brown sugar, salt, and water in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil; cook until the caramel is very dark, and bubbles appear, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off heat.
Carefully whisk in 2 tablespoons butter; pour in heavy cream and continue to stir. Be careful, as the mixture may boil up in the pan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Whisk in milk.
Whisk whole egg, egg yolks, and cornstarch together in a mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of the hot cream mixture to temper the egg mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the saucepan and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer, and cook, whisking, until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and pour into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl to remove any lumps. Whisk in rum.
Pour into serving glasses. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes, before wrapping in plastic wrap and refrigerating until thoroughly chilled, 3 to 4 hours.
