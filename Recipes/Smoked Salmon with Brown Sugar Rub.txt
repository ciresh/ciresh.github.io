3-4 pound King or Sockeye salmon fillet.
Dry Rub
1 cup light brown sugar, packed (1/2 c){1/3 c}
1 cup non-iodized table salt (1/2 c){1/3 c}
3 tablespoons granulated garlic powder (4 1/2 t) {1 tablespoon}
3 tablespoons granulated onion (4 1/2 t) {1 tablespoon}
1 tablespoon dried dill weed (1 1/2 t) {1 teaspoon}
1 tablespoon dried savory (1 1/2 t) {1 teaspoon}
2 teaspoons dried tarragon (1 t) {3/4 teaspoon}
Mix all ingredients thoroughly.

Place the salmon flesh-side up on a non-reactive platter or in a glass baking dish. Pour all of the rub over the salmon and spread it evenly over the surface, about 1/4" thick.

Move the salmon into the refrigerator for 2-3 hours. 

Next, rinse the fillet thoroughly under cold running water to remove all the salt and sugar. Pat all surfaces dry with paper towels. You'll notice that the fillet now has a more intense color.

Place the fillet flesh-side up on a clean platter or sheet pan and let it dry until tacky, about 30 minutes. This tackiness is known as "pellicle". It is the result of water-soluble proteins drawn to the surface of the fish by the rub that dry to create a sticky layer. This layer prevents moisture loss and attracts and holds smoke particles during cooking.

You can dry the fish in the refrigerator, or on the kitchen counter in front of an electric fan.

Finishing Rub
1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed (2 T) {4 t} 
1 tablespoon granulated garlic powder (1.5 t) {1 t}
1 tablespoon granulated onion (1.5 t) {1 t} 
1 teaspoon dried savory (1/2 t) {1/4 t}
1 teaspoon dried tarragon (1/2 t) {1/4 t}

Cook the fillet at 225-250°F to a final internal temperature of 140-155°F. Use a Polder probe thermometer or other instant-read thermometer to monitor the internal temperature in the thickest part of the fillet. Should take around 1 1/2 hours.

There is no need to turn or baste the salmon during cooking.

Remove the fillet from the cooker when it is about 5°F below your desired final internal temperature. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the residual heat to finish cooking the salmo
