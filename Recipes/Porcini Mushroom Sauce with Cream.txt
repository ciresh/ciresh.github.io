Enough for 1 pound of pasta

Toss this intensely flavored sauce with one pound of dried (or one and one-quarter pound of fresh) fettuccine and one-half cup of Parmesan cheese. Pass extra cheese at the table.
INGREDIENTS
3  	tablespoons  unsalted butter 
1  	medium onion , minced
2  	ounces  dried porcini mushrooms , rehydrated in 2 cups hot water, strained, and chopped coarse; soaking liquid reserved
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
6  	tablespoons  heavy cream 
3  	tablespoons  minced fresh parsley leaves  
1. Heat butter in large sauté pan over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until edges begin to brown, about 7 minutes. Add porcini and salt and pepper to taste; sauté to release flavors, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Increase heat to medium-high. Add soaking liquid; simmer briskly until liquid has reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
3. Stir in cream; simmer until sauce just starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in parsley, adjust seasonings, and serve.
