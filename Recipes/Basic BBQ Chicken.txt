Basic BBQ Chicken

2 chickens, 3.5 to 4 pounds each

All-Purpose Dry Rub
1/4 cup paprika
4 teaspoons table salt
4 teaspoons ground black pepper
4 teaspoons granulated sugar
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Remove backbone, split in half, trim fat.

Sprinkle a moderate amount of rub on both sides of the chicken halves.

Prepare Smoker: Use 1 full chimeny lit, 1/2 chimeny unlit.

Arrange the chicken skin-side up on the grate and put the lid in place.

Set the lid vent and the three bottom vents 100% open and leave them that way throughout the entire cooking process.

Cook the chicken for 45 minutes. No peeking allowed!

After 45 minutes, lift the lid and quickly brush the skin with a thin coat of your favorite barbecue sauce and replace the lid.

Cook for another 15 minutes and then check the internal meat temperature using an instant-read thermometer. The chicken is done when the breast meat registers about 160°F and the thigh registers about 170°F.

As a final step, crisp the chicken skin directly over the hot coals.
