Rich And Tender Yellow Layer Cake

To bring the eggs and milk to room temperature (65°F), submerge them in a bowl of warm water for about 10 minutes after mixing them together. 

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. 

	4 large eggs , room temperature
	1/2 cup whole milk , room temperature
	2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Beat with fork in small bowl. Measure out 1 cup.

	2 1/4 cups sifted cake flour
	1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	3/4 teaspoon table salt

Mix with paddle attachment on lowest speed for 30 seconds
	1/2	lb unsalted butter, softened in 8 pieces

Add butter one piece at a time; until begin to clump together and look sandy and pebbly and  pieces about the size of peas, 30 to 40 seconds after all butter is added.

Add reserved 1 cup of egg mixture and mix at lowest speed until incorporated, 5 to 10 seconds. 

Increase speed to medium-high (setting 6) and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.

Add remaining egg mixture (about 1/2 cup) in slow steady stream, about 30 seconds. Stop mixer and thoroughly scrape sides and bottom of bowl. Beat on medium-high until thoroughly combined and batter looks slightly curdled, about 15 seconds longer.

Divide batter equally smooth with rubber spatula. Bake until cake tops are light golden and skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on rack 10 minutes. Run a knife around pan perimeter to loosen. Invert cake onto large plate, peel off parchment, and re-invert onto lightly greased rack. Cool completely before icing.
