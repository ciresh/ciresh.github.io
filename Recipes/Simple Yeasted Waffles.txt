Simple Yeasted Waffles

2 1/4 cups milk
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus more for the waffle iron
15 grams sugar (1 tablespoon)
5 grams salt (1 teaspoon)
1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
240 grams all-purpose flour (2 cups)
90 grams whole wheat flour (3/4 cup), or use all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1. In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk and butter until melted and hot but not simmering. Stir in sugar and salt; remove from heat and let cool to lukewarm.

2. In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup warm water and yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

3. Add warm milk mixture to yeast and stir. Whisk in flours. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand until doubled in volume, 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.

4. Heat waffle iron. Whisk eggs and baking soda into waffle batter. Using a pastry brush or paper towel, lightly coat iron with melted butter. Cook waffles (using about 1/2 cup batter per waffle) until golden and crisp. Butter the iron in between batches as needed. Serve waffles immediately as they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200-degree oven until ready to serve.
