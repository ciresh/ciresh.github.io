Southwestern Turkey Hash

Serves 6

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 medium onions, chopped (about 2 cups)
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 cups frozen corn, thawed
1 large sweet potato (about 1 pound), peeled if desired, cooked, and cut into  1/2-inch cubes (about 2 1/2 cups)
3 medium poblano peppers, charred over a gas flame or under a broiler, peeled, seeded, and cut into strips
1 pound leftover roasted turkey, cut into  1/2-inch cubes (about 3 cups)
Salt and black pepper
1/3 cup half-and-half
5 scallions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon lime juice, or to taste

In a large, heavy (preferably cast-iron) skillet, heat the oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and golden, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin, stir to mix, and cook until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the corn, sweet potatoes, poblano peppers, turkey, 1  1/2 teaspoons salt, black pepper to taste, and half-and-half, and stir to distribute. Pat the mixture flat in the pan, and cook until moisture evaporates and the bottom begins to brown, 10 to 20 minutes. With a wooden spoon, stir the hash, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen the crust. Stir to distribute the brown bits into the hash, flatten it in the pan again, adjust heat to medium-low, and continue to cook until a new crust starts to form, about 5 minutes. Again, scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen the crust. Add the scallions and lime juice, stir to blend, adjust seasoning with salt, black pepper, or lime juice, if necessary, and serve at once.
