I talked to Monica about it, and she recommended coating skinless, boneless breasts in heavy cream, then roasting them.  I tried this, and baked four large breasts at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes until the tops became light brown.  (I salted and peppered them, then dipped them in cream and placed them on a cookie sheet that was lined with aluminum foil and lightly oiled.)

After they cooled, I cut them across the grain in about 1/2 inch slices, and pulled those slices apart with my hands into small bite-sized pieces. It made about five cups of chicken, which, coincidentally is what the recipe called for.  Here's the recipe:

5 cups chicken meat, roasted and shredded into bite sized pieces
2 medium celery ribs, cut into small dice
2 medium scallions, white and green parts, minced
3/4-1 cup of mayonnaise
1 1/2 to 2 tbsp. lemon juice
2 tbsp. fresh minced parsley
salt and pepper to taste.

Mix together and serve.

They offer a jazzed up version called Curried Chicken Salad with Raisins and Honey.  Basically the same recipe to which has been added curry powder, honey, golden raisins and the option of cilantro instead of parsley:

One recipe basic chicken salad
6 tbsp. golden raisins
2 tsp. curry powder
1 tbsp. honey
