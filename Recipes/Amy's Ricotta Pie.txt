To assemble Pies
- Egg wash rims / Cut thin lattice strips, at least ten per pie, or 30 altogether.
- Arrange five strips across each pie. Press down to adhere.
- Arrange five more strips over the top, criss-crossing diagonally.
- Trim the edges neatly, removing excess dough.
- Gently egg wash the lattice.
- Bake directly on oven shelf or pizza stone, about 45 minutes, until set.
- Cool completely before cutting.
- Store refrigerated but bring up to room temp or warmer for serving.

4. Temper the egg mixture by slowly whisking in the hot milk in a thin stream.
5. Return the mixture to the large saucepan and bring to a boil, SCRAPING THE BOTTOM and whisking constantly. When it thickens and comes to a boil, remove from heat. Be careful the bottom does not scorch!
