Foolproof pie dough for a single-crust pie

3/4 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1 tablespoon sugar 
	Blend together in food processor until combined, about 2 one-second pulses.

6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, 1/4-inch slices
1/4 cup chilled shortening cut into 2 pieces
	Process until is starts to collect in uneven clumps, about 10 seconds (dough will resemble cottage cheese curds with some very small pieces of butter remaining, but there should be no uncoated flour).

1/2 cup flour
	Pulse until mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up, 4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl

2 tablespoons vodka, cold
2 tablespoons cold water
	Sprinkle over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together. Flatten dough into 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 45 minutes or up to 2 days.

Oven to 425 degrees, rac to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on oven rack, and heat. 

Roll out on floured (up to 1/4 cup) work surface to 12-inch 1/8 inch thick circle. Put in pie plate, refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes.

Trim overhang to 1/2 inch and fold under itself (should be flush with edge) and flute. Refrigerate about 15 minutes.

Line crust with foil, and fill with pie weights and bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights, rotate plate, and bake for 5 to 10 minutes until crust is golden brown and crisp.
