Basic Cream Cheese Fruit Dip

1 8-ounce package cream cheese,softened
3 tablespoons sugar
1 cup sour cream or Mascarpone
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Combine all ingredients and beat until smooth and creamy.

Variations:

Almond Fruit Dip:

Add 3 tablespoons finely chopped almonds and 1 1/2 teaspoons almond liqueur to the basic recipe. Garnish with 1 tablespoon finely chopped almonds, if desired.

Raspberry Fruit Dip:
Puree 1 cup sweetened raspberries (aprox. 1 10-ounce package). Spoon half the basic recipe into a serving dish and smooth. Top with half the raspberry puree and smooth. Repeat.

      If you like this you might also want to try warm Very Berry Fondue . After all, what is fondue if not dip? 

Lemon Fruit Dip:
Add zest of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 extra tablespoon sugar to the basic cream cheese fruit dip recipe.

Marshmallow Fruit Dip:

Add 1/2 cup marshmallow creme to the basic recipe.

All recipes: Chill and serve with assorted fruit dippers such as bananas, grapes, kiwi, apple, pineapple, strawberries, raspberries, and papaya, cut into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Bagel bites are good, too. Makes 2 to 3 cups.

Presentation Tip:

Serve your Fruit Dip Recipes in a 'fruit bowl'. Cut an orange or grapefruit in half crosswise. Cut a thin slice off the bottom of each half so it sits flat. Slice around the edge of the fruit; remove the fruit and the membrane. Spoon the dip into the shells. Serve one and refrigerate the other one for later.

Some recipes from my archives - including one that Roselin just posted the other day.

ROSELIN'S BRICKLE DIP
This is from Taste of Home and is always asked for here:

1 8 oz pk cream cheese, softened
1/2 c brown sugar
1/4 c white sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 pk brickle chips
Beat together cream cheese, sugars, and vanilla.
Fold in chips. Serve with fruit.

I know it's too late, but cream cheese and a bottle of pina colada mix is great and easy. You don't use the whole bottle, just enough to get the consistency you want.

Darn, I'm too late too, but sour cream mixed with brown sugar is divine. Try 4 parts sour cream to one part brown sugar and adjust from there.
The crystals melt, so it isn't grainy. It's especially delicious with strawberries.

FRUIT WITH CANNOLI CREAM
(4 servings)
Posted by: Ruthanna (My Page) on Sun, Jul 14, 02 at 8:16

1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1/3 cup sugar
¾ tsp. orange zest
3 Tbs. orange juice
2 Tbs. mini chocolate chips
1 apple, cored and cut into 8 wedges
1 pear, cored and cut into 8 wedges
1 plum, pitted and cut into 8 wedges
1 pint strawberries, hulled
In a blender or food processor, combine the cheese, sugar, orange peel and orange juice and process until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and fold in 1 Tbs. of the chocolate chips. Place the fruit on a platter and spoon the ricotta mixture over it. Sprinkle with remaining chocolate chips, and serve. Note: You can also arrange the fruit in four large goblets or wine glasses and top each portion with some of the sauce and chips. Other fresh fruits can be substituted. Apricots, raspberries and blueberries are all good in this recipe.

Here are a couple pretty tasty ones I've served before:

Dream Fruit Dip

12 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
1 cup confectioners’ sugar, unsifted
7 oz. jar marshmallow crème
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
1-2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 tablespoons cognac (optional)

In small bowl, with electric mixer, cream the cheese until soft and smooth. Add the sugar and beat until well blended. Add the sour cream and the rest of the ingredients. Blend just until well-combined. Cover and chill several hours before serving.

8 oz cream cheese
1/2 c sour cream
1 c whipped cream
1/4 c brown sugar
1/4 c white sugar

Here's a similar one but it doesn't use cream cheese. It's really easy.
marshmallow creme
sour cream (I use fat free)
Mix equal amounts of them together.

Here's my favorite:

8 oz. cream cheese
1 sm. jar marshmallow cream
1/2 can cream of coconut

Blend cream cheese until fluffy; add cream of coconut (be sure and stir the can up well before using). Beat in marshmallow cream.

I prefer Raskas cream cheese, from Costco.

I don't like the marshmallow cream one cause it's wayyyy too sweet for me, but I love the one I make. It's just cream cheese whipped and stir in as much piña colada mixer to make it the consistency you want. You could probably also just use coconut liqueur.
