Turkey Meat Loaf
From Cooking Light

"This dish is packed with flavor and is a family favorite at my house. I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes--Yukon golds are the best choice--and grilled or steamed vegetables. If you're making it for a red-meat lover, it's OK to replace one pound of the ground turkey with ground round." -CL Reader

2  pounds ground turkey breast
1  cup quick-cooking oats
1/2  cup ketchup
1/4  cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4  cup (1 ounce) grated fresh Parmesan cheese
1  tablespoon dried oregano
3  tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2  tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2  teaspoons dried basil
1  teaspoon garlic powder
Cooking spray
1/4  cup ketchup

Preheat oven to 400°.

Combine the first 10 ingredients in a large bowl.

Place the turkey mixture in a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Top with 1/4 cup ketchup. Bake at 400° for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until done. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
