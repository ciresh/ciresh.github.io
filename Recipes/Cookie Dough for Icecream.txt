Cookie Dough for Ice Cream (Eggless)

A wonderful addition to any ice cream. Turn any vanilla
ice cream into cookie dough. Much better than the store
bought cookie dough ice cream. NOTE: This does not include
the ice cream recipe - just the dough. Prep Time: approx.
5 Minutes. Ready in: approx. 20 Minutes. Makes 8
servings.
