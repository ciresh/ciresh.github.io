Best Ribs In The Universe Rub - 1/4 Batch
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup non-iodized table salt
1/8 cup brown sugar, dried
4 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon Accent (MSG)
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon onion powder

Dry brown sugar for several hours or place it in warm oven. Once dried, place brown sugar in a Ziploc bag and break up any clumps using a rolling pin or the bottom of a drinking glass. Apply a good overall dusting of rub to the ribs. Allow the ribs to sit at room temperature for two hours 

Fire up a full chimeny of charcoal. To this add an additional.  During the first three hours, adjust the bottom vents to maintain a cooker temperature of 225°F. At the three hour mark, open the cooker for the first time and turn the ribs over, but do not baste them with anything.

Replace the lid and open the bottom vents to increase the cooker temperature to 250-275°F. Start checking for doneness at the four hour mark and every 30 minutes thereafter. The ribs will be done when they have a nice, brown color and the meat passes the tear test.

Check the water pan every two hours and replenish with hot tap water, as needed.

Mike's recipe calls for saucing the ribs on both sides before serving with a mixture of 5 parts KC Masterpiece Original Flavor barbecue sauce to 1 part honey.
