RECIPE: Fresh Margaritas
The longer you let the zest and juice mixture steep, the more intensely citrusy your margaritas will be. We recommend steeping for the full 24 hours, although the margaritas will still be great if the mixture is steeped for the minimum four hours. If you're in a rush and need to serve the drinks immediately, omit the zest and skip the steeping process altogether. We suggest using reposado ("rested") tequila, which is made from 100 percent blue agave and aged for between two and 12 months. Tasters liked its mellow flavor and thought it blended perfectly with the other ingredients.

Makes about 1 quart, serving 4 to 6

    * 4 teaspoons grated lime zest
    * 1/2 cup lime juice from 2 to 3 medium limes
    * 4 teaspoons grated lemon zest
    * 1/2 cup lemon juice from 2 to 3 medium lemons
    * 1/4 cup superfine sugar
    * Pinch table salt
    * 2 cups crushed ice
    * 1 cup 100 percent agave tequila, preferably reposado
    * 1 cup triple sec

1. Combine lime zest and juice, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and salt in large liquid measuring cup; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors meld, 4 to 24 hours.

2. Divide 1 cup crushed ice between 4 to 6 margarita or double old-fashioned glasses. Strain juice mixture into 1-quart pitcher or cocktail shaker. Add tequila, triple sec, and remaining crushed ice; stir or shake until thoroughly combined and chilled, 20 to 60 seconds. Strain into ice-filled glasses; serve immediately.
