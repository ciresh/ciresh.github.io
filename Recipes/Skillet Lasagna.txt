Skillet Lasagna

Serves 4 to 6

Meatloaf mix is a combination of ground beef, pork, and veal, sold pre-packaged in many supermarkets. If it's unavailable, use ground beef. Use a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a tight-fitting lid for this recipe.
	1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 
	Water 
1 	tablespoon olive oil 
1 	medium onion , minced
	Table salt 
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1/8 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
1 	pound meatloaf mix 
10 	curly-edged lasagna noodles , broken into 2-inch lengths
	1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce 
1/2 	cup grated Parmesan cheese plus 2 additional tablespoons
	Ground black pepper 
1 	cup ricotta cheese 
3 	tablespoons chopped fresh basil  

1. Pour tomatoes with their juices into 1-quart liquid measuring cup. Add water until mixture measures 1 quart.

2. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ground meat and cook, breaking apart meat, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes.

3. Scatter pasta over meat but do not stir. Pour diced tomatoes with juices and tomato sauce over pasta. Cover and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes.

4. Remove skillet from heat and stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Dot with heaping tablespoons ricotta, cover, and let stand off heat for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with basil and remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Serve.
