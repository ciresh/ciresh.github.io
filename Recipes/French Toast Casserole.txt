Ingredients

1 loaf stale bread (I used a French batard but Italian, sourdough, cinammon or good old sandwich white or wheat would be good)
6 eggs
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup half and half or cream
3/4 cups sugar
2 tablespoons vanilla
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick butter, cubed
undefined
Preparation
Pre-heat the oven to 350Â°F.


Spray a 9-inch x 13- inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.


Tear the bread into chunks and place them in the greased pan. Mix together the eggs, milk, half and half or cream, sugar, and vanilla and pour the mixture evenly over the bread. In another bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Add the butter and mix until the batter comes somewhat together. Sprinkle the flour/sugar mixture evenly over the top of the bread mixture. Bake for 45-60 minutes, until golden brown. Store any leftovers in fridge, tightly covered.
