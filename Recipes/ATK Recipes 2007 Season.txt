Acorn Squash with Brown Sugar
from the Episode: Best Beef Stew
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Squash smaller than 1 1/2 pounds will likely cook a little faster than the recipe indicates, so begin checking for doneness a few minutes early. Conversely, larger squash will take slightly longer to cook. However, keep in mind that the cooking time is largely dependent on the microwave. If microwaving the squash in Pyrex, the manufacturer recommends adding water to the dish (or bowl) prior to cooking. To avoid a steam burn when uncovering the cooked squash, peel back the plastic wrap very carefully, starting from the side that is farthest away from you.

Serves 4
2 	acorn squash (about 1 1/2 pounds each), halved pole to pole and seeded
	table salt 
3 	tablespoons unsalted butter 
3 	tablespoons dark brown sugar 


See Illustrations Below: Two Ways to Cut Squash Safely--Knife and Rubber Mallet

1. Sprinkle squash halves with salt and place halves cut-sides down in 13- by 9-inch microwave-safe baking dish or arrange halves in large (about 4-quart) microwave-safe bowl so that cut sides face out (see photo). If using Pyrex, add 1/4 cup water to dish or bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, using multiple sheets, if necessary; with paring knife, poke about 4 steam vents in plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until squash is very tender and offers no resistance when pierced with paring knife, 15 to 25 minutes. Using potholders, remove baking dish or bowl from oven and set on clean, dry surface (avoid damp or cold surfaces).

2. While squash is cooking, adjust oven rack to uppermost position (about 6 inches from heating element); heat broiler. Melt butter, brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in small saucepan over low heat, whisking occasionally, until combined.

3. When squash is cooked, carefully pull back plastic wrap from side farthest from you. Using tongs, transfer cooked squash cut-side up to rimmed baking sheet. Spoon portion of butter/sugar mixture onto each squash half. Broil until brown and caramelized, 5 to 8 minutes, rotating baking sheet as necessary and removing squash halves as they are done. Set squash halves on individual plates and serve immediately.

arbecued Beef Brisket For a Charcoal Grill
from the Episode: Barbecued Brisket and Corn Fritters
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Cooking a whole brisket, which weighs about 10 pounds, may seem like overkill. However, the process is easy, and the leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. (Leave leftover brisket unsliced, and reheat the foil-wrapped meat in a 300-degree oven until warm.) Still, if you don’t want to bother with a big piece of meat or if your grill has fewer than 400 square inches of cooking space, barbecuing brisket for less than a crowd is easy to do. Simply ask your butcher for either the point or flat portion of the brisket, whichever cut you prefer. Then follow the master recipe, reducing the spice rub by half and grill-smoking for 1 1/2 hours. Wrap the meat tightly in foil and reduce its time in the oven to 2 hours. No matter how large or small a piece you cook, it’s a good idea to save the juices the meat gives off while in the oven to enrich the barbecue sauce. Hickory and mesquite are both traditional wood choices with brisket.

Serves 18 to 24

Spicy Chili Rub
4 	tablespoons paprika 
2 	tablespoons chili powder 
2 	tablespoons ground cumin 
2 	tablespoons dark brown sugar 
2 	tablespoons table salt 
1 	tablespoon ground oregano 
1 	tablespoon granulated sugar 
1 	tablespoon ground black pepper 
1 	tablespoon ground white pepper 
2 	teaspoons cayenne pepper 

Brisket
1 	whole beef brisket (point and flat cut together), 9 to 11 pounds, fat trimmed to 1/4-inch thickness
3 	cups barbecue sauce (store-bought if preferred)
2 	wood chunks (3-inch)


See Illustrations Below: Key Steps to Barbecued Brisket

1. For Spicy Chili Rub: Mix all ingredients in small bowl.

2. Apply dry rub liberally to all sides of brisket; wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 48 hours.

3. For Brisket: About 1 hour prior to cooking, remove the brisket from the refrigerator, unwrap, and let it come up to room temperature. Soak the wood chunks in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.

4. Meanwhile, light a large chimney starter filled a bit less than halfway with charcoal briquettes (2 1/2 quarts, or about 45 briquettes) and allow to burn until the coals are fully ignited and partially covered with a thin layer of ash. Empty the coals into one side of the grill, piling them up in a mound 2 or 3 briquettes high. Keep the bottom vents completely open. Place the wood chunks on top of the charcoal. Put the cooking grate in place, open the grill lid vents completely, and cover, turning the lid so that the vents are opposite the wood chunks to draw smoke through the grill. Let the grate heat up for 5 minutes and then scrape the grate clean with a grill brush.

5. Position the brisket, fat side up, on the side of the grill opposite the fire. Barbecue, without removing the lid, for 2 hours. (The initial temperature will be about 350 degrees and will drop to 250 degrees after 2 hours.)

6.Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 300 degrees. Attach 2 pieces of heavy-duty foil, 4 feet long, by folding the long edges together 2 or 3 times, crimping tightly to seal well, to form an approximately 4 by 3 foot rectangle. Position the brisket lengthwise in the center of the foil. Bring the short edges over the brisket and fold down, crimping tightly to seal. Repeat with the long sides of the foil to seal the brisket completely. (See illustrations below.) Place the brisket on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the meat is fork-tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

7. Remove the brisket from the oven, loosen the foil at one end to release steam, and let rest for 30 minutes. If you like, drain the juices into a bowl (see illustration) and defat the juices in a gravy skimmer.

Unwrap the brisket and place it on a cutting board. Separate the meat into two sections and carve it on the bias across the grain into long, thin slices (see illustrations). Serve with plain barbecue sauce or with barbecue sauce that has been flavored with up to 1 cup of the defatted brisket juices.

4 	tablespoons paprika 
2 	tablespoons chili powder 
2 	tablespoons ground cumin 
2 	tablespoons dark brown sugar 
2 	tablespoons table salt 
1 	tablespoon ground oregano

1 	tablespoon ground black pepper 
1 	tablespoon ground white pepper 
2 	teaspoons cayenne pepper 

Brisket
1 	whole beef brisket (point and flat cut together), 9 to 11 pounds, fat trimmed to 1/4-inch thickness
3 	cups barbecue sauce (store-bought if preferred)
2 	cups wood chips 


See Illustrations Below: Making a Wood Chip Tray

1. For Spicy Chili Rub: Mix all ingredients in small bowl.

2. Apply dry rub liberally to all sides of brisket; wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 48 hours.

3. For Brisket: About 1 hour prior to cooking, remove the brisket from the refrigerator, unwrap, and let it come up to room temperature. Soak the wood chips in cold water to cover for 30 minutes and drain. Place them in a foil tray, (see illustration below).

4. Place the tray on top of the primary burner. Light all the burners and turn to high, cover, and heat until the chips are smoking heavily, about 20 minutes. Scrape the cooking grate clean with a grill brush. Turn the primary burner down to medium and turn off the other burner(s). Position the brisket, fat side up, over the cooler part of the grill. Cover and barbecue for 2 hours. (The temperature inside the grill should be a constant 275 degrees; adjust the lit burner as necessary.)

5. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 300 degrees. Attach 2 pieces of heavy-duty foil, 4 feet long, by folding the long edges together 2 or 3 times, crimping tightly to seal well, to form an approximately 4 by 3 foot rectangle. Position the brisket lengthwise in the center of the foil. Bring the short edges over the brisket and fold down, crimping tightly to seal. Repeat with the long sides of the foil to seal the brisket completely. (See illustrations below.) Place the brisket on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the meat is fork-tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

6. Remove the brisket from the oven, loosen the foil at one end to release steam, and let rest for 30 minutes. If you like, drain the juices into a bowl (see illustration) and defat the juices in a gravy skimmer.

7. Unwrap the brisket and place it on a cutting board. Separate the meat into two sections and carve it on the bias across the grain into long, thin slices (see illustrations).

from the Episode: Tex-Mex Favorites
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

The chicken and vegetables in these fajitas are only mildly spicy. For more heat, include the jalapeño seeds and ribs when mincing. Although the chicken and vegetables have enough flavor to stand on their own, accompaniments (guacamole, salsa, sour cream, shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese, and/or lime wedges) can be offered at the table. The chicken tenderloins can be reserved for another use or marinated and cooked along with the breasts.

Serves 4 to 6
1/3 	cup lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes)
6 	tablespoons vegetable oil 
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1 	tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
1 1/2 	teaspoons brown sugar 
1 	jalapeño chile , seeds and ribs removed, chile minced
1 1/2 	tablespoons minced fresh cilantro leaves 
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
3 	boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds), trimmed of fat, tenderloins removed, breasts pounded to 1/2-inch thickness
1 	large red onion (about 14 ounces), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds (do not separate rings)
1 	large red bell pepper (about 10 ounces), quartered, stemmed, and seeded
1 	large green bell pepper (about 10 ounces), quartered, stemmed, and seeded
8 - 12 	plain flour tortillas (6-inch)


See Illustrations Below: Forgettable Chicken Fajitas

1. In medium bowl, whisk together lime juice, 4 tablespoons oil, garlic, Worcestershire, brown sugar, jalapeño, cilantro, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Reserve 1/4 cup marinade in small bowl; set aside. Add another teaspoon salt to remaining marinade. Place chicken in marinade; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 15 minutes.

2. Adjust one oven rack to upper-middle position (about 8 inches from heating element) and second rack to lower-middle position; heat broiler.

3. Brush both sides of onion rounds and peppers with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange onion rounds and peppers (skin sides up) in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Wrap tortillas securely in foil in two packets, each containing half of tortillas.

4. Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels; discard marinade. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Swirl oil to coat skillet, then arrange chicken smooth side down in skillet in single layer; cook without moving chicken, until well browned, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken; continue to cook until second sides are well browned, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, turning chicken once or twice, until chicken is no longer pink when cut into with paring knife or instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part registers 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to large plate and let rest 5 minutes.

5. While chicken is cooking, place baking sheet with vegetables in oven on upper rack; place tortilla packets on lower rack. Broil vegetables until spottily charred and peppers are crisp-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer peppers to cutting board. Flip onion rounds and continue to broil until charred and tender, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Turn off broiler and remove vegetables, leaving tortillas in oven until needed.

6. Separate onions into rings and place in medium bowl; slice bell peppers lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips and place in bowl with onions. Add 2 tablespoons reserved unused marinade to vegetables and toss well to combine. Slice chicken into 1/4-inch strips and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons reserved marinade in separate bowl; arrange chicken and vegetables on large platter and serve with warmed tortillas.

Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

A handheld mixer can easily do the job of a standing mixer in this recipe, though mixing times may vary slightly. Garnish each serving of mousse with a thin strip of orange zest, if desired.

Makes 3 1/2 cups (6 to 8 servings)
1 	cup heavy cream , plus 2 more tablespoons (chilled)
3 	strips orange zest , from 1 orange, each about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide)
8 	ounces bittersweet chocolate , chopped fine

See Illustrations Below: Getting the Mousse Texture Right

1. Bring heavy cream to simmer in medium saucepan. Remove from heat and transfer to liquid measuring cup; add 3 strips of orange zest (each about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide). Cool until just warm, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Remove and discard zest; add more heavy cream, if necessary, to replace any evaporation loss.

2. Melt chocolate, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and water in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in Grand Marnier.

3. Whisk egg yolks, 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in medium bowl until mixture lightens in color and thickens slightly, about 30 seconds. Pour melted chocolate into egg mixture and whisk until thoroughly combined. Let cool until slightly warmer than room temperature, 3 to 5 minutes.

4. In clean bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites at medium-low speed until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 1 minute. Detach whisk and bowl from mixer and whisk last few strokes by hand, making sure to scrape any unbeaten whites from bottom of bowl. Using whisk, stir about one-quarter of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it; gently fold in remaining egg whites with rubber spatula until a few white streaks remain.

5. Whip orange-flavored cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 15 seconds longer. Using rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream into mousse until no white streaks remain. Spoon mousse into 6 to 8 individual serving dishes or goblets. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set and firm, at least 2 hours. (The mousse may be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)

Dark Chocolate Cupcakes
from the Episode: Dark Chocolate Desserts
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

This recipe does not double very well. Cupcakes made from a doubled batch and baked side by side in the oven yield a slightly compromised rise. It's best to make two separate batches and bake each separately. Store leftover cupcakes (frosted or unfrosted) in the refirgerator, but let them come to room temperature before serving.

Makes 12 cupcakes
8 	tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 4 pieces
2 	ounces bittersweet chocolate , chopped
1/2 	cup Dutch-processed cocoa (1 1/2 ounces)
3/4 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour (3 3/4 ounces)
1/2 	teaspoon baking soda 
3/4 	teaspoon baking powder 
2 	large eggs 
3/4 	cup sugar (5 1/4 ounces)
1 	teaspoon vanilla extract 
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2 	cup sour cream (4 ounces)


See Illustrations Below: Oven Temperature Really Matters

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Line standard-sized muffin pan (cups have 1/2-cup capacity) with baking-cup liners.

2. Combine butter, chocolate, and cocoa in medium heatproof bowl. Set bowl over saucepan containing barely simmering water; heat mixture until butter and chocolate are melted and whisk until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool until just warm to the touch.

3. Whisk flour, baking soda, and baking powder in small bowl to combine.

4. Whisk eggs in second medium bowl to combine; add sugar, vanilla, and salt and whisk until fully incorporated. Add cooled chocolate mixture and whisk until combined. Sift about one-third of flour mixture over chocolate mixture and whisk until combined; whisk in sour cream until combined, then sift remaining flour mixture over and whisk until batter is homogenous and thick.

5. Divide batter evenly among muffin pan cups. Bake until skewer inserted into center of cupcakes comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.

6. Cool cupcakes in muffin pan on wire rack until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Carefully lift each cupcake from muffin pan and set on wire rack. Cool to room temperature before icing, about 30 minutes. (To frost: Mound about 2 tablespoons icing on center of each cupcake. Using small icing spatula or butter knife, spread icing to edge of cupcake, leaving slight mound in center.)

Everyday Lighter Macaroni and Cheese
from the Episode: Lighter Family Favorites
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Don’t be tempted to use either preshredded or nonfat cheddar cheese in this dishthe texture and flavor of the macaroni and cheese will suffer substantially. For best results, choose a low-fat cheddar cheese that is sold in block form and has roughly 50 percent of the fat and calories of regular cheese (we like Cabot brand).

This recipe was published in The Best Light Recipe.

Serves 5
	Salt 
3/8 	pound elbow macaroni (about 2 cups)
1 	(12-ounce) can 2 percent reduced-fat evaporated milk 
2/3 	cup low-fat milk (2 percent)
1/4 	teaspoon dry mustard 
1/8 	teaspoon garlic powder or celery salt (optional)
	Pinch cayenne pepper 
2 	teaspoons cornstarch 
8 	ounces 50 percent light cheddar cheese , grated (about 2 cups)

1. Bring 2 1/2 quarts water to a boil in a large saucepan. Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and the macaroni; cook until the pasta is completely cooked and tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the pasta and leave it in the colander; set aside.

2. Add the evaporated milk, 1/2 cup of the 2 percent milk, mustard, garlic powder (if using), cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the now-empty saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Whisk the cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup milk together, then whisk it into the simmering mixture. Continue to simmer, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened and is smooth, about 2 minutes.

3. Off the heat, gradually whisk in the cheddar until melted and smooth. Stir in the macaroni, and let the macaroni and cheese sit off the heat until the sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 5 minutes, before serving.

Gas-Grilled Shrimp Skewers
from the Episode: Summer Cooking
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

The shrimp and sauce (see related recipes for choices) finish cooking together on the grill, so prepare the sauce ingredients while the coals are heating, then carry them out to the grill with you. To fit all of the shrimp on the cooking grate at once, you’ll need three 14-inch metal skewers. (Wooden skewers will likely burn.) Serve with grilled crusty bread brushed with olive oil as an appetizer; add rice salad or couscous for a main course.

Serves 4 as a main course, 6 as an appetizer
1 1/2 	pounds extra-large shrimp (21/25), peeled and deveined, tails left on
2 - 3 	tablespoons olive oil for brushing skewers
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
1/4 	teaspoon sugar 
1 	recipe Spicy Lemon-Garlic Sauce, Charmoula Sauce, or Fresh Tomato Sauce with Feta and Olives

See Illustrations Below: Crowding Shrimp Onto a Skewer

1. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Thread shrimp onto 3 skewers, alternating direction of heads and tails. Brush both sides of shrimp with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle one side of each skewer with sugar.

2. Turn all burners on gas grill to high, cover, and heat until very hot, about 15 minutes. Scrape grate clean with grill brush.

3. Set disposable aluminum pie plate with sauce ingredients on grill and cook as directed; remove when hot. Place shrimp skewers, sugared sides down, on grate; use tongs to push shrimp together on skewer if they have separated. Grill shrimp, covered, until lightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, flip and grill until second side is pink and slightly translucent, 1 to 2 minutes longer.

4. Using potholder or oven mitt, carefully lift each skewer from grill; use tongs to slide shrimp off skewers into pie plate with sauce. Toss shrimp and sauce to combine and transfer pie plate back to grill; cook, stirring, until shrimp are opaque and fully cooked, about 30 seconds. Remove from grill, add remaining sauce ingredients and toss to combine. Transfer to serving platter and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

Glazed Pork Chops
from the Episode: Two Ways with Pork
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

If your chops are on the thinner side, check their internal temperature after the initial sear. If they are already at the 140-degree mark, remove them from the skillet and allow them to rest, tented with foil, for 5 minutes, then add the platter juices and glaze ingredients to the skillet and proceed with step 3. If your chops are closer to 1 inch thick, you may need to increase the simmering time in step 2.

Serves 4

Glaze
1/2 	cup distilled white vinegar or cider vinegar
1/3 	cup light brown sugar 
1/3 	cup apple cider or apple juice
2 	tablespoons Dijon mustard 
1 	tablespoon soy sauce 
	Pinch cayenne pepper 

Chops
4 	boneless, center-cut pork loin chops , 5 to 7 ounces each, 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
1 	tablespoon vegetable oil 


See Illustrations Below: Prepping Boneless Pork Chops

1. Combine all glaze ingredients in medium bowl; mix thoroughly and set aside. Following illustrations below, trim chops and slash through fat and silver skin with sharp knife, making 2 cuts about 2 inches apart in each chop (do not cut into meat of chops). Pat chops dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper.

2. Heat oil in heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Add pork to skillet and cook until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Turn chops and cook 1 minute longer; transfer chops to plate and pour off any oil in skillet. (Check internal temperature of thinner chops; see note above.) Return chops to skillet, browned side up, and add glaze mixture; cook over medium heat until center of chops registers 140 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; transfer chops to clean platter, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes.

3. When chops have rested, add any accumulated juices to skillet and set over medium heat. Simmer, whisking constantly, until glaze is thick and color of dark caramel (heatproof spatula should leave wide trail when dragged through glaze), 2 to 6 minutes. Return chops to skillet; turn to coat both sides with glaze. Transfer chops back to platter, browned side up, and spread remaining glaze over chops. Serve immediately.

from the Episode: Meat Loaf Dinner
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

If you can't find chuck and/or sirloin, substitute any 85 percent lean ground beef. Handle the meat gently; it should be thoroughly combined but not pastelike. To avoid using the broiler, glaze the loaf in a 500-degree oven; increase cooking time for each interval by 2 to 3 minutes.

Serves 6 to 8

Meat Loaf
3 	ounces Monterey Jack cheese , grated on small holes of box grater (about 1 cup)
1 	tablespoon unsalted butter 
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
1 	medium rib celery , chopped fine (about 1/2 cup)
1 	medium clove garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
2 	teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves  
1 	teaspoon paprika 
1/4 	cup tomato juice 
1/2 	cup low-sodium chicken broth 
2 	large eggs 
1/2 	teaspoon unflavored gelatin (powdered)
1 	tablespoon soy sauce 
1 	teaspoon Dijon mustard 
2/3 	cup crushed saltine crackers 
2 	tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves 
3/4 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
1 	pound ground sirloin 
1 	pound ground beef chuck 

Glaze
1/2 	cup ketchup 
1 	teaspoon hot pepper sauce 
1/2 	teaspoon ground coriander 
1/4 	cup cider vinegar 
3 	tablespoons packed light brown sugar 


See Illustrations Below: Creating a Free-Form "Loaf Pan"

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Spread cheese on plate and place in freezer until ready to use. Prepare baking sheet (see illustration below).

2. Heat butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until foaming; add onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, and paprika and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and add tomato juice. Cook, stirring to scrape up browned bits from pan, until thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to small bowl and set aside to cool.

3. Whisk broth and eggs in large bowl until combined. Sprinkle gelatin over liquid and let stand 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, mustard, saltines, parsley, salt, pepper, and onion mixture. Crumble frozen cheese into coarse powder and sprinkle over mixture. Add ground beef; mix gently with hands until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to foil rectangle and shape into 10 by 6-inch oval about 2 inches high. Smooth top and edges of meat loaf with moistened spatula. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of loaf reads 135 to 140 degrees, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove meat loaf from oven and turn on broiler.

4. While meat loaf cooks, combine ingredients for glaze in small saucepan; bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring, until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Spread half of glaze evenly over cooked meat loaf with rubber spatula; place under broiler and cook until glaze bubbles and begins to brown at edges, about 5 minutes. Remove meat loaf from oven and spread evenly with remaining glaze; place back under broiler and cook until glaze is again bubbling and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes more. Let meat loaf cool about 20 minutes before slicing.

Grill-Roasted Beer Can Chicken for a Gas Grill
from the Episode: Beer Can Chicken Dinner
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Be sure not to open the lid of the gas grill too often during cooking; the temperature of the grill will drop significantly each time you open it. If you prefer, use lemonade instead of beer; fill an empty 12-ounce soda or beer can with 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) of lemonade and proceed as directed.

Serves 4

Spice Rub
1/2 	cup sweet paprika 
2 	tablespoons kosher salt 
2 	tablespoons garlic powder 
1 	tablespoon dried thyme 
2 	teaspoons ground celery seed 
2 	teaspoons ground black pepper 
2 	teaspoons cayenne pepper 

Chicken
2 	cups wood chips 
1 	whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds)
1 	can beer (12-ounce), see note
2 	bay leaves 
	Large disposable aluminum baking pan (13 by 9-inch)


See Illustrations Below: Making a Wood Chip Tray

1.For Spice Rub: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Measure 3 tablespoons for use in this recipe. Extra rub can be stored (or frozen) in an airtight container for several weeks.

2. For Chicken: Soak the wood chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain. Place the wood chips in a foil tray (see the illustrations below). Place the tray on top of the primary burner of a gas grill and replace the cooking grate(s). Light all the burners and turn to high, cover, and heat until the chips are smoking heavily, abut 15 minutes.

3. Massage the spice rub all over the chicken, inside and out. Lift up the skin over the breast and rub the spice rub directly onto the meat. Open the beer can and pour out (or drink) about 1/4 cup. With a church key can opener, punch two more large holes in the top of the can (for a total of three holes). Crumble the bay leaves into the beer. Slide the chicken over the can so that the drumsticks reach down to the bottom of the can and the chicken stands upright; set aside at room temperature.

4. Carefully open the grill (there may be some smoke) and scrape the cooking grate clean with a grill brush. Turn the primary burner down to medium and turn off the other burner(s). Place the chicken over the cool part of the grill with a wing side facing the primary burner. Cover and grill-roast for 35 minutes, adjusting the lit burner as needed to maintain a temperature of 325 to 350 degrees inside the grill. Rotate the chicken so that the drumstick and wing that were facing away from the lit burner are now facing toward it. Cover and continue to grill-roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees, 25 to 40 minutes longer.

5. With a large wad of paper towels in each hand, transfer the chicken to a platter or tray, making sure to keep the can upright; let rest for 15 minutes. Using wads of paper towels, carefully lift the chicken off the can and onto a platter or cutting board. Discard the remaining beer and can. Carve the chicken and serve.

Grill-Roasting Two Chickens: There are some occasions when you may want to cook more than one chicken—when you have more guests to serve or if you’d like to have leftovers on hand. Here’s how:

Increase the amount of wood chips to 4 cups, use 6 tablespoons Spice Rub, and use two 3 1/2 pound chickens. Set the chickens (with cans) over the cool part of the grill, with a wing side facing the primary burner, allowing as much room around each chicken as possible. Grill-roast as directed.

Grill-Roasted Beer Can Chicken for a Charcoal Grill
from the Episode: Beer Can Chicken Dinner
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Using the right amount of charcoal is crucial here; using too much charcoal will burn the chicken, while using too little will extend the cooking time substantially. The temperature inside the grill should be about 375 degrees at the outset and will fall to about 300 by the time the chicken is done. For added accuracy, place a grill thermometer in the lid vents as the chicken cooks. If you prefer, use lemonade instead of beer; fill an empty 12-ounce soda or beer can with 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) of lemonade and proceed as directed.

Serves 4

Spice Rub
1/2 	cup sweet paprika 
2 	tablespoons kosher salt 
2 	tablespoons garlic powder 
1 	tablespoon dried thyme 
2 	teaspoons ground celery seed 
2 	teaspoons ground black pepper 
2 	teaspoons cayenne pepper 

Chicken
2 	cups wood chips , or 2 (3-inch) wood chunks
1 	whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds)
1 	can beer (12-ounce), see note
2 	bay leaves 
	Large disposable aluminum baking pan (13 by 9-inch)


See Illustrations Below: Setting Up Beer Can Chicken

1.For Spice Rub: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Measure 3 tablespoons for use in this recipe. Extra rub can be stored (or frozen) in an airtight container for several weeks.

2. For Chicken: Soak the wood chunks or chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain. If using wood chips, divide them between two 18-inch squares of aluminum foil, seal to make two packets, and use a fork to create about six holes in each packet to allow smoke to escape.

3. Massage the spice rub all over the chicken, inside and out. Lift up the skin over the breast and rub the spice rub directly onto the meat. Open the beer can and pour out (or drink) about 1/4 cup. With a church key can opener, punch two more large holes in the top of the can (for a total of three holes). Crumble the bay leaves into the beer. Slide the chicken over the can so that the drumsticks reach down to the bottom of the can and the chicken stands upright; set aside at room temperature.

4. Light a large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal (4 quarts, or about 60 briquettes) and allow to burn until the coals are fully ignited and partially covered with a thin layer of ash, 15 to 20 minutes.

5. Place the disposable pan in the center of the grill. Pour half of the coals into a pile on each side of the grill, leaving the pan in the center. Nestle 1 soaked wood chunk (or 1 foil packet) on top of each coal pile. Position the cooking grate over the coals, cover the grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape the grate clean with a grill brush.

6. Place the chicken (with the can) in the center of the cooking grate with the wings facing the coals (the ends of the drumsticks will touch the grate and help steady the bird, see the illustration below). Cover and grill-roast, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees, 65 to 85 minutes.

7. With a large wad of paper towels in each hand, transfer the chicken to a platter or tray, making sure to keep the can upright; let rest for 15 minutes. Using wads of paper towels, carefully lift the chicken off the can and onto a platter or cutting board. Discard the remaining beer and can. Carve the chicken and serve.

Grill-Roasting Two Chickens: There are some occasions when you may want to cook more than one chicken—when you have more guests to serve or if you’d like to have leftovers on hand. Here’s how:

Increase the number of wood chunks to 4 (or 4 cups of wood chips), use 6 tablespoons Spice Rub, two 3 1/2 pound chickens and increase the amount of charcoal to a three-quarters full chimney (4 1/2 quarts, or about 70 briquettes). In step 6, set the chickens (and cans) in the middle of the cooking grate, with the chickens breasts facing one another, about 3 inches apart (keeping the chickens close together ensures that they won’t hit the top of the domed grill lid). Grill-roast as directed.

Key Lime Bars
from the Episode: Favorite Citrus Desserts
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

If you cannot find fresh Key limes, use regular (Persian) limes. Do not use bottled lime juice. Grate the zest from the limes before juicing them, avoiding the bitter white pith that lies just beneath the outermost skin. The optional coconut garnish adds textural interest and tames the lime flavor for those who find it too intense. The recipe can be doubled and baked in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan; you will need a double layer of extra-wide foil for the pan (each sheet about 20 inches in length) and should increase the baking times by a minute or two.

Makes sixteen 2-inch bars

Crust
5 	ounces animal crackers 
3 	tablespoons packed brown sugar (light or dark)
	Pinch table salt 
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted and cooled slightly

Filling
2 	ounces cream cheese , room temperature
1 	tablespoon grated lime zest , minced
	Pinch table salt 
1 	(14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 
1 	egg yolk 
1/2 	cup fresh lime juice , either Key lime or regular

Garnish (optional)
3/4 	cup sweetened shredded coconut , toasted until golden and crisp


See Illustrations Below: Building Key Lime Bars

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Cut about 12-inch length extra-wide heavy-duty foil; fold cut edges back to form 7 1/2-inch width. With folded sides facing down, fit foil securely into bottom and up sides of 8-inch-square baking pan, allowing excess to overhang pan sides. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray.

2. TO MAKE THE CRUST: In workbowl of food processor, pulse animal crackers until broken down, about ten 1-second pulses; process crumbs until evenly fine, about 10 seconds (you should have about 1 1/4 cups crumbs). Add brown sugar and salt; process to combine, ten to twelve 1-second pulses (if large sugar lumps remain, break them apart with fingers). Drizzle butter over crumbs and pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened with butter, about ten 1-second pulses. Press crumbs evenly and firmly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake until deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack while making filling. Do not turn off oven.

3. TO MAKE THE FILLING: While crust cools, in medium bowl, stir cream cheese, zest, and salt with rubber spatula until softened, creamy, and thoroughly combined. Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk vigorously until incorporated and no lumps of cream cheese remain; whisk in egg yolk. Add lime juice and whisk gently until incorporated (mixture will thicken slightly).

4. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Pour filling into crust; spread to corners and smooth surface with rubber spatula. Bake until set and edges begin to pull away slightly from sides, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack to room temperature, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Cover with foil and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours.

5. Loosen edges with paring knife and lift bars from baking pan using foil extensions; cut bars into 16 squares. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if using, and serve. (Leftovers can be refrigerated up to 2 days; crust will soften slightly. Let bars stand at room temperature about 15 minutes before serving.)

Lemon Bundt Cake
from the Episode: Favorite Citrus Desserts
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

You will need between five and six tablespoons of lemon juice for this recipe. Because the amount of juice can vary from lemon to lemon, we suggest you first measure the juice from the three lemons you have zested, then juice a fourth lemon if necessary. Serve this cake as is or dress it up with lightly sweetened berries. The cake has a light, fluffy texture when eaten the day it is baked, but if well wrapped and held at room temperature overnight its texture becomes more dense -- like that of pound cake -- the following day.

Serves 12 to 14

Cake
3 	lemons , zest grated and saved, then juiced for 3 tablespoons juice (see note above)
3 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (15 ounces)
1 	teaspoon baking powder 
1/2 	teaspoon baking soda 
1 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	teaspoon vanilla extract 
3/4 	cup low-fat buttermilk (preferably)
3 	large eggs , at room temperature
1 	large egg yolk , at room temperature
18 	tablespoons unsalted butter (2 1/4 sticks), at room temperature
2 	cups sugar (14 ounces)

Glaze
2 - 3 	tablespoons fresh lemon juice (see note above)
1 	tablespoon buttermilk 
2 	cups confectioners' sugar (8 ounces)


See Illustrations Below: Lemon Anatomy 101

1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 12-cup Bundt pan with nonstick baking spray with flour (alternatively, brush pan with mixture of 1 tablespoon flour and 1 tablespoon melted butter). Mince lemon zest to fine paste (you should have about 2 tablespoons). Combine zest and lemon juice in small bowl; set aside to soften, 10 to 15 minutes.

2. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Combine lemon juice mixture, vanilla, and buttermilk in medium bowl. In small bowl, gently whisk eggs and yolk to combine. In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, cream butter and sugar at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes; scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Reduce to medium speed and add half of eggs, mixing until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Repeat with remaining eggs; scrape down bowl again. Reduce to low speed; add about one-third of flour mixture, followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until just incorporated after each addition (about 5 seconds). Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture. Scrape bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Scrape into prepared pan.

3. Bake until top is golden brown and wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into center comes out with no crumbs attached, 45 to 50 minutes.

4. FOR THE GLAZE: While cake is baking, whisk 2 tablespoons lemon juice, buttermilk, and confectioners' sugar until smooth, adding more lemon juice gradually as needed until glaze is thick but still pourable (mixture should leave faint trail across bottom of mixing bowl when drizzled from whisk). Cool cake in pan on wire rack set over baking sheet for 10 minutes, then invert cake directly onto rack. Pour half of glaze over warm cake and let cool for 1 hour; pour remaining glaze evenly over top of cake and continue to cool to room temperature, at least 2 hours. Cut into slices and serve.

Light New York Cheesecake
from the Episode: Lighter Desserts
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Be sure to use light cream cheese, which is commonly sold in tubs. Don’t confuse light cream cheese with Neufchatel cheese, which is sold in blocks and is higher in fat. Allowing the cottage cheese to drain on towels for at least 30 minutes will ensure a firm cheesecake. You can buy yogurt cheese (also called Labne) or make your own, (see related recipe). If making your own cheese, you will need to allow at least 12 hours for the yogurt to drain. You can substitute fat free cream cheese for the yogurt cheese, but the cheesecake will have a slightly firmer texture.

This recipe was published in The Best Light Recipe.

Serves 12

Crust
9 	whole graham crackers (5 ounces), broken into rough pieces and processed in a food processor to fine even crumbs (about 1 1/4 cups)
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted
1 	tablespoon sugar 

Filling
1 	tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
1 	pound 1% cottage cheese 
1 	pound light cream cheese , at room temperature
8 	ounces yogurt cheese (see note)
1/4 	teaspoon table salt 
1 1/2 	cups sugar (10 1/2 ounces)
1/2 - 1 	teaspoon lemon zest 
1 	tablespoon vanilla extract 
3 	large eggs , at room temperature
	Vegetable cooking spray 

Fresh Strawberry Topping
1 	pound fresh strawberries , hulled and cut lengthwise into 1/4- to 3/8-inch wedges
1/4 	cup sugar 
	Pinch table salt 
1/2 	cup strawberry jam 

1. For the crust: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar together in a medium bowl. Transfer the mixture to a 9-inch springform pan and press evenly into the pan bottom. Bake the crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.

2. For the filling: Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees. Line a medium bowl with a clean dish towel or several layers of paper towels. Spoon the cottage cheese into the bowl and let drain for 30 minutes.

3. Process the drained cottage cheese in a food processor until smooth and no visible lumps remain, about 1 minute, scraping down the work bowl once or twice. Add the cream cheese and yogurt cheese and process until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down the work bowl once or twice. Add the salt, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla and continue to process until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down the work bowl once or twice. With the processor running, add the eggs, one at a time and process until smooth.

4. Being careful to not disturb the baked crust, spray the sides of the springform pan with vegetable oil spray. Set the springform pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake 10 minutes. Without opening the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees and continue to bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the cheesecake reads 150 degrees, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

5. Transfer the cake to a wire rack, and run a paring knife around the edge of the cake. Let cool until barely warm, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, running a paring knife around the edge of the cake every hour or so. Wrap the pan tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours.

6. To unmold the cheesecake, wrap a hot kitchen towel around the springform pan and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan and blot any excess moisture from the top of the cheesecake with paper towels. Let the cheesecake stand at room temperature about 30 minutes, then cut into wedges.

8. For the Topping: Toss the berries, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and let stand until the berries have released some juice and the sugar has dissolved, about 30 minutes, tossing occasionally to combine.

9. Process the jam in a food processor until smooth, about 8 seconds. Transfer the jam to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until dark and no longer frothy, about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, then gently stir the warm jam into the strawberries. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or up to 12. To serve, spoon a portion of sauce over individual slices of cheesecake.

Lighter Chicken Parmesan with Simple Tomato Sauce
from the Episode: Lighter Family Favorites
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

If you are tight on time, you can substitute 2 cups of your favorite plain tomato sauce for the Simple Tomato Sauce. Two cups of fresh bread crumbs can be substituted for the panko (they will shrink as they toast). Because these cutlets are breaded, we found that one cutlet per person was plenty—but try to buy the largest chicken breasts you can to ensure good-sized portions.

Serves 6
1 1/2 	cups panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)
1 	tablespoon olive oil 
1 	ounce grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup), plus extra for serving
1/2 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour 
1 1/2 	teaspoons garlic powder 
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
3 	large egg whites 
1 	tablespoon water 
	Vegetable cooking spray 
3 	large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 8 ounces each), trimmed of excess fat and sliced into cutlets
2 	cups tomato sauce , warmed (see below)
3 	ounces shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese (about 3/4 cup)
1 	tablespoon minced fresh basil 

Simple Tomato Sauce
	1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 
4 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 4 teaspoons)
1 	tablespoon tomato paste 
1 	teaspoon olive oil 
1/8 	teaspoon red pepper flakes 
1 	tablespoon minced fresh basil leaves 
	Table salt and ground black pepper 


See Illustrations Below: Preparing the Chicken Cutlets

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 475 degrees. Combine the bread crumbs and oil in a 12-inch skillet and toast over medium heat, stirring often, until golden, about 10 minutes. Spread the bread crumbs in a shallow dish and cool slightly; when cool, stir in the Parmesan.

2. In a second shallow dish, combine the flour, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together. In a third shallow dish, whisk the egg whites and water together.

3. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, place a wire rack on top, and spray the rack with vegetable oil spray. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, then season with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge the cutlets in the flour, shaking off the excess, then dip into the egg whites, and finally coat with the bread crumbs, Press on the bread crumbs to make sure they adhere. Lay the chicken on the wire rack.

4. Spray the tops of the chicken with vegetable oil spray. Bake until the meat is no longer pink in the center and feels firm when pressed with a finger, about 15 minutes.

5. Remove the chicken from the oven. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the sauce onto the center of each cutlet and top the sauce with 2 tablespoons of the mozzarella. Return the chicken to the oven and continue to bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the basil and serve, passing the remaining sauce and Parmesan separately.

For Simple Tomato Sauce:
Pulse the tomatoes in a food processor until mostly smooth, about ten 1-second pulses; set aside. Cook the garlic, tomato paste, oil, and pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the tomato paste begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the pureed tomatoes and cook until the sauce is thickened and measures 2 cups, about 20 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the basil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and set aside until needed.

Marinara Sauce
from the Episode: Italian Classics
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

This recipe makes enough to sauce more than a pound of pasta; leftovers can be refrigerated or frozen. Because canned tomatoes vary in acidity and saltiness, it's best to add salt, pepper, and sugar to taste just before serving. If you prefer a chunkier sauce, give it just three or four pulses in the food processor in step 4.

Makes 4 cups
2 	(28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes , packed in juice
2 	tablespoons olive oil 
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
2 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
1/2 	teaspoon dried oregano 
1/3 	cup dry red wine , such as Chianti or Merlot
3 	tablespoons chopped fresh basil  
1 	tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
1 - 2 	teaspoons sugar , as needed (see note above)


See Illustrations Below: Getting Slow-Simmered Flavor Fast

1. Pour tomatoes and juice into strainer set over large bowl. Open tomatoes with hands and remove and discard fibrous cores; let tomatoes drain excess liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove 3/4 cup tomatoes from strainer and set aside. Reserve 2 1/2 cups tomato juice and discard remainder.

2. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden around edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.

3. Add tomatoes from strainer and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring every minute, until liquid has evaporated and tomatoes begin to stick to bottom of pan and brown fond forms around pan edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Add wine and cook until thick and syrupy, about 1 minute. Add reserved tomato juice and bring to simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally and loosening browned bits, until sauce is thick, 8 to 10 minutes.

4. Transfer sauce to food processor (or transfer to saucepan and insert immersion blender; see the related article "Do You Really Need a Hand Blender?") and add reserved tomatoes; process until slightly chunky, about eight 2-second pulses. Return sauce to skillet and add basil and extra-virgin olive oil and salt, pepper, and sugar to taste.

Old-Fashioned Chocolate Layer Cake
from the Episode: Old-Fashioned Chocolate Cake
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Do not substitute semisweet chocolate chips for the chopped semisweet chocolate in the frosting—chocolate chips contain less cocoa butter than bar chocolate and will not melt as readily. For best results, don't make the frosting until the cakes are cooled, and use the frosting as soon as it is ready. If the frosting gets too cold and stiff to spread easily, wrap the mixer bowl with a towel soaked in hot water and mix on low speed until the frosting appears creamy and smooth. Refrigerated leftover cake should sit at room temperature before serving until the frosting softens.

Serves 10 to 12

Cake
12 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), very soft, plus extra for greasing pans
1 3/4 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (8 3/4 ounces), plus extra for dusting pans
4 	ounces unsweetened chocolate , coarsely chopped
1/4 	cup Dutch-processed cocoa (3/4 ounce)
1/2 	cup hot water 
1 3/4 	cups sugar (12 1/4 ounces)
1 1/2 	teaspoons baking soda 
1 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	cup buttermilk 
2 	teaspoons vanilla extract 
4 	large eggs 
2 	large egg yolks 

Frosting
16 	ounces semisweet chocolate , finely chopped
8 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)
1/3 	cup sugar 
2 	tablespoons corn syrup 
2 	teaspoons vanilla extract 
1/4 	teaspoon table salt 
1 1/4 	cups heavy cream (cold)


See Illustrations Below: Secrets to Old-Fashioned Chocolate Layer Cake

1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch-round by 2-inch-high cake pans with softened butter; dust pans with flour and knock out excess. Combine chocolate, cocoa powder, and hot water in medium heatproof bowl; set bowl over saucepan containing 1 inch of simmering water and stir with rubber spatula until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sugar to chocolate mixture and stir until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to cool.

2. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Combine buttermilk and vanilla in small bowl. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whisk eggs and yolks on medium-low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. Add remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, increase speed to high, and whisk until fluffy and lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Replace whisk with paddle attachment. Add cooled chocolate mixture to egg/sugar mixture and mix on medium speed until thoroughly incorporated, 30 to 45 seconds, pausing to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add softened butter one tablespoon at a time, mixing about 10 seconds after each addition. Add about one-third of flour mixture followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until incorporated after each addition (about 15 seconds). Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture (batter may appear separated). Scrape down sides of bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans; smooth batter to edges of pan with spatula.

3. Bake cakes until toothpick inserted into center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes in pans 15 minutes, then invert onto wire rack. Cool cakes to room temperature before frosting, 45 to 60 minutes.

4. TO MAKE FROSTING: Melt chocolate in heatproof bowl set over saucepan containing 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside. Meanwhile, heat butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted. Increase heat to medium; add sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt and stir with heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, 4 to 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, butter mixture, and cream to clean bowl of standing mixer and stir to thoroughly combine.

5. Place mixer bowl over ice bath and stir mixture constantly with rubber spatula until frosting is thick and just beginning to harden against sides of bowl, 1 to 2 minutes (frosting should be 70 degrees). Place bowl on standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until frosting is light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir with rubber spatula until completely smooth.

6. TO FROST CAKE: Place one cake layer on serving platter or cardboard round. Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting evenly across top of cake with spatula. Place second cake layer on top, then spread remaining frosting evenly over top and sides of cake. Cut into slices and serve.

Potstickers
from the Episode: Not Your Average Stir-Fry
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

We prefer to use gyoza wrappers. You can substitute wonton wrappers, but the cooking time and recipe yield will vary (see the chart below Step 3). Potstickers are best served hot from the skillet; we recommend that you serve the first batch immediately, then cook the second batch. To freeze potstickers, place filled, uncooked dumplings in the freezer in a single layer on a plate until frozen, then transfer to a storage bag. There's no need to thaw frozen potstickers; just proceed with the recipe.

Makes 24 dumplings, 6 first course servings

Filling
3 	cups minced napa cabbage leaves 
3/4 	teaspoon table salt 
3/4 	pound ground pork 
6 	tablespoons minced scallions (about 4 medium scallions, white and green parts)
1/8 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
4 	teaspoons soy sauce 
1 1/2 	teaspoons grated fresh ginger 
1 	medium clove garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
2 	egg whites , lightly beaten


24 	gyoza wrappers , round, (see note above)
4 	teaspoons vegetable oil 


See Illustrations Below: Wrapping Potstickers

1. Toss cabbage and salt in colander or mesh strainer set over medium bowl. Let stand until cabbage begins to wilt, about 20 minutes; press cabbage gently with rubber spatula to squeeze out excess moisture. Combine cabbage and all other filling ingredients in medium bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until mixture is cold, at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.

2. Place 4 wrappers flat on work surface (keep remaining wrappers covered with plastic wrap). Following illustration 1, above, place one slightly rounded tablespoon filling in center of each wrapper. Using pastry brush or fingertip, moisten edge of wrapper with water. Fold each wrapper in half; starting in center and working toward outside edges, pinch edges together firmly to seal, pressing out any air pockets (illustrations 2 and 3). Position each dumpling on its side and gently flatten, pressing down on seam to make sure it lies flat against work surface (illustration 4). Repeat to form 24 dumplings. (Filled dumplings can be refrigerated overnight in single layer on baking sheet wrapped tightly with plastic wrap.)

3. Add 2 teaspoons oil to 12-inch nonstick skillet and quickly spread oil with paper towel to distribute evenly. Arrange 12 dumplings in skillet, lying flat on one side, with all seams facing same direction, overlapping just slightly, if necessary. Place skillet over medium-high heat and cook, without moving, until dumplings are golden brown on bottoms, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add 1/2 cup water to skillet, and cover immediately. Cook, covered, until most of water is absorbed and wrappers are slightly translucent, about 10 minutes. Uncover skillet and increase heat to medium-high; cook, without stirring, until dumpling bottoms are well browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes more. Turn off burner and slide dumplings from skillet onto double layer paper towels, browned side down, to blot excess oil. Transfer to platter and serve immediately with Scallion Dipping Sauce (see related recipe). Let skillet cool until just warm, then wipe skillet clean and repeat with remaining dumplings and oil.

Choosing the Right Wrap
Tasters preferred the slightly chewy texture of gyoza-style wrappers to thinner wonton wrappers, but both styles produced terrific potstickers. Although we developed our recipe using round wrappers, square or rectangular wrappers can be used as well. Here's how to adjust filling amount and steaming time. Because the smaller wrappers yield more dumplings, you'll need to cook them in multiple batches. (For wrapping instructions, see instructions below.)

WRAPPER
Round gyoza (3 3/4 inches diameter), fill with 1 rounded tablespoon, steam for 10 minutes
Round wonton (3 3/4 inches diameter), fill with 1 rounded tablespoon, steam for 6 minutes
Square wonton (3 3/8 inches square), fill with 2 rounded teaspoons, steam for 6 minutes
Rectangular wonton (3 1/4 inches by 2 3/4 inches), fill with 1 rounded teaspoon, steam for 5 minutes

Premium Dark Chocolate Mousse
from the Episode: Dark Chocolate Desserts
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

This recipe is designed to work with a boutique chocolate that contains a higher percentage of cacao than the Ghirardelli chocolate recommended in our Dark Chocolate Mousse. A handheld mixer can easily do the job of a standing mixer in this recipe, though mixing times may vary slightly.

Makes 3 1/2 cups (6 to 8 servings)
8 	ounces bittersweet chocolate , 62 to 70 percent cacao, chopped fine
3 	tablespoons granulated sugar 
2 	tablespoons Cocoa powder , preferably Dutch-processed
1 	teaspoon instant espresso powder 
7 	tablespoons water 
1 	tablespoon brandy 
3 	large eggs , separated
1/8 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	cup heavy cream , plus 2 more tablespoons (chilled)


See Illustrations Below: Getting the Mousse Texture Right

1. Melt chocolate, 2 tablespoons sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, water, and brandy in medium heatproof bowl set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat.

2. Whisk egg yolks, 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in medium bowl until mixture lightens in color and thickens slightly, about 30 seconds. Pour melted chocolate into egg mixture and whisk until thoroughly combined. Let cool until slightly warmer than room temperature, 3 to 5 minutes.

3. In clean bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites at medium-low speed until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 1 minute. Detach whisk and bowl from mixer and whisk last few strokes by hand, making sure to scrape any unbeaten whites from bottom of bowl. Using whisk, stir about one-quarter of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it; gently fold in remaining egg whites with rubber spatula until a few white streaks remain.

4. Whip heavy cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 15 seconds longer. Using rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream into mousse until no white streaks remain. Spoon mousse into 6 to 8 individual serving dishes or goblets. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set and firm, at least 2 hours. (The mousse may be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)

Quick Barbecue Sauce
from the Episode: Rainy Day Barbecue
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

Classic barbecue sauce must simmer for a long time for the whole tomatoes in it to break down. However, we found that starting with ketchup can shorten the process. Use this sauce as you would any other barbecue sauce—either brushed on foods during the last minutes of grilling or served at the table as a dipping sauce with ribs or brisket.

Makes about 1 1/2 cups
1 	medium onion , peeled and quartered
1/4 	cup water 
1 	cup ketchup 
5 	tablespoons molasses 
2 	tablespoons cider vinegar 
2 	tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
2 	tablespoons Dijon mustard 
1 1/2 	teaspoons liquid smoke (optional)
1 	teaspoon hot pepper sauce 
1/4 	teaspoon ground black pepper 
2 	tablespoons vegetable oil 
1 	medium clove garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
1 	teaspoon chili powder 
1/4 	teaspoon cayenne pepper 

1. Process the onion with the water in a food processor until pureed and the mixture resembles slush, about 30 seconds. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula to obtain 1/2 cup juice. Discard the solids.

2. Whisk the onion juice, ketchup, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire, mustard, liquid smoke (if using), hot pepper sauce, and black pepper together in a medium bowl.

3. Heat the oil in a large nonreactive saucepan over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the garlic, chili powder, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk in the ketchup mixture and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, uncovered, until the flavors meld and the sauce is thickened, about 25 minutes. Cool the sauce to room temperature before using. (The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.)

Triple Citrus Bars
from the Episode: Favorite Citrus Desserts
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

If you cannot find fresh Key limes, use regular (Persian) limes. Do not use bottled lime or lemon juice. Grate the zest from the citrus fruit before juicing, avoiding the bitter white pith that lies just beneath the outermost skin. The optional coconut garnish adds textural interest and tames the citrus flavor for those who find it too intense. The recipe can be doubled and baked in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan; you will need a double layer of extra-wide foil for the pan (each sheet about 20 inches in length) and should increase the baking times by a minute or two. Mince zest after measuring.

Makes sixteen 2-inch bars

Crust
5 	ounces animal crackers 
3 	tablespoons packed brown sugar (light or dark)
	Pinch table salt 
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted and cooled slightly

Filling
2 	ounces cream cheese , room temperature
1 1/2 	teaspoons grated lime zest , minced
1 1/2 	teaspoons grated lemon zest , minced
1 1/2 	teaspoons grated orange zest , minced
	Pinch table salt 
1 	(14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 
1 	egg yolk 
6 	tablespoons fresh lime juice , either Key lime or regular
1 	tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
1 	tablespoon fresh orange juice 

Garnish (optional)
3/4 	cup sweetened shredded coconut , toasted until golden and crisp


See Illustrations Below: Building Key Lime Bars

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Cut about 12-inch length extra-wide heavy-duty foil; fold cut edges back to form 7 1/2-inch width. With folded sides facing down, fit foil securely into bottom and up sides of 8-inch-square baking pan, allowing excess to overhang pan sides. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray.

2. TO MAKE THE CRUST: In workbowl of food processor, pulse animal crackers until broken down, about ten 1-second pulses; process crumbs until evenly fine, about 10 seconds (you should have about 1 1/4 cups crumbs). Add brown sugar and salt; process to combine, ten to twelve 1-second pulses (if large sugar lumps remain, break them apart with fingers). Drizzle butter over crumbs and pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened with butter, about ten 1-second pulses. Press crumbs evenly and firmly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake until deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack while making filling. Do not turn off oven.

3. TO MAKE THE FILLING: While crust cools, in medium bowl, stir cream cheese, zests, and salt with rubber spatula until softened, creamy, and thoroughly combined. Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk vigorously until incorporated and no lumps of cream cheese remain; whisk in egg yolk. Add juices and whisk gently until incorporated (mixture will thicken slightly).

4. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Pour filling into crust; spread to corners and smooth surface with rubber spatula. Bake until set and edges begin to pull away slightly from sides, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack to room temperature, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Cover with foil and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours.

5. Loosen edges with paring knife and lift bars from baking pan using foil extensions; cut bars into 16 squares. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if using, and serve. (Leftovers can be refrigerated up to 2 days; crust will soften slightly. Let bars stand at room temperature about 15 minutes before serving.)

Chicken Fajitas for Charcoal Grill
from the Episode: Tex-Mex Favorites
Buy the 2007 Cookbook, Get the 2007 DVD Boxed Set FREE!

The chicken and vegetables in these fajitas are only mildly spicy. For more heat, include the jalapeño seeds and ribs when mincing. When you head outside to grill, bring along a clean kitchen towel or a large piece of foil in which to wrap the tortillas and keep them warm as they come off the grill. Although the chicken and vegetables have enough flavor to stand on their own, accompaniments (guacamole, salsa, sour cream, shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese, and lime wedges) can be offered at the table. For our recipes for salsa and guacamole, see related recipes. The chicken tenderloins can be reserved for another use or marinated and grilled along with the breasts.

Serves 4 to 6
1/3 	cup lime juice , from 2 to 3 limes
6 	tablespoons vegetable oil 
3 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1 	tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
1 1/2 	teaspoons brown sugar 
1 	jalapeño chile , seeds and ribs removed, chile minced
1 1/2 	tablespoons minced fresh cilantro leaves 
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
3 	boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds), trimmed of fat, tenderloins removed, breasts pounded to 1/2-inch thickness
1 	large red onion (about 14 ounces), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds (do not separate rings)
1 	large red bell pepper (about 10 ounces), quartered, stemmed, and seeded
1 	large green bell pepper (about 10 ounces), quartered, stemmed, and seeded
8 - 12 	plain flour tortillas (6-inch)


See Illustrations Below: Forgettable Chicken Fajitas

1. In medium bowl, whisk together lime juice, 4 tablespoons oil, garlic, Worcestershire, brown sugar, jalapeño, cilantro, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Reserve 1/4 cup marinade in small bowl; set aside. Add another teaspoon salt to remaining marinade. Place chicken in marinade; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 15 minutes. Brush both sides of onion rounds and peppers with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper.

2. Meanwhile, using large chimney starter, ignite 6 quarts charcoal briquettes and burn until coals are fully ignited, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill, spreading them in even single layer; place additional 20 unlit coals over lit coals on one side of grill to create two-level fire. Position grill grate over coals and heat grate 5 minutes; scrape clean with grill brush.

3. Remove chicken from marinade and place chicken smooth side down on hotter side of grill; discard remaining marinade. Place onion rounds and peppers (skin side down) on cooler side of grill. Cook chicken until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes; using tongs, flip chicken and continue grilling until chicken is no longer pink when cut into with paring knife or instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers about 160 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Meanwhile, cook peppers until spottily charred and crisp-tender, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once or twice as needed; cook onions until tender and charred on both sides, 10 to 12 minutes, turning every 3 to4 minutes. When chicken and vegetables are done, transfer to large plate; tent with foil to keep warm.

4. Working in 2 or 3 batches, place tortillas in single layer on cooler side of now-empty grill and cook until warm and lightly browned, about 20 seconds per side (do not grill too long or tortillas will become brittle). As tortillas are done, wrap in kitchen towel or large sheet of foil.

5. Separate onions into rings and place in medium bowl; slice bell peppers lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips and place in bowl with onions. Add 2 tablespoons reserved unused marinade to vegetables and toss well to combine. Slice chicken into 1/4-inch strips and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons reserved marinade in another bowl; arrange chicken and vegetables on large platter and serve with warmed tortillas.
