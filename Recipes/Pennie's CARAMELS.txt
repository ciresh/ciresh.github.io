Pennie's CARAMELS (5 pounds)

1 lb. butter 
2 lbs. brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt 
16 oz. Light Karo syrup 
2 (15-oz.) cans Eagle Brand Sweetened condensed milk
1 tablespoon Vanilla extract 

Melt butter in a heavy 6-quart pan. Add brown sugar and salt. Stir in corn syrup, mixing well. Gradually add milk, stirring constantly. Cook over a medium heat until it reaches the firm ball stage (245 degrees). Remove from heat, stir in vanilla. Pour into a well buttered 11” x 18” jellyroll pan. Cool, cut, and wrap in wax paper squares. 

CHECK YOUR THERMOMETER before you start to make the caramels, by placing it in boiling water for a few minutes. It should register at 212 degrees, if it doesn’t then add or subtract accordingly. 

I use a non-stick jelly roll pan and then when the caramel is cool I turn it out on a huge board and cut it. I also get the special wax paper squares from Sweet Celebrations, see page 132 of their catalog Item B. It is a heavy duty, double sided wax paper that is already cut and comes in different colors.
