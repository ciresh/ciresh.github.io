INGREDIENTS
Oreo Crust
20 Oreos (about ¾ of a full package)
5 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Peanut Butter Filling
1½ (15 oz) cups creamy peanut butter
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
Chocolate Ganache
1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
½ cup heavy whipping cream
INSTRUCTIONS
Oreo Crust
Add Oreos to a food processor and pulse until you have fine crumbs.
Add the melted butter to the food processor and pulse a couple more times to combine. (If your food processor is not big enough you can do this in two batches or mix in a small bowl)
Press into a 9 inch pie pan and place crust in the freezer for 10 minutes to set.
Peanut Butter Filling
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream butter and peanut butter until smooth.
Add in powdered sugar and vanilla and beat on low speed until incorporated.
Spoon the peanut butter mixture into the crust. Place in the refrigerator while you are working on your ganache.
Chocolate Ganache
Add chocolate chips, peanut butter and heavy cream to a microwave safe bowl. Heat in 15 second intervals until fully melted.
Allow the ganache to cool for about 2-3 minutes. Pour and spread ontop of the peanut butter layer.
Place back in the refrigerator for at least 1 hours to set.
