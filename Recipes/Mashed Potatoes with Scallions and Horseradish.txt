Mashed Potatoes with Scallions and Horseradish
Serves 4

2 	pounds russet potatoes , unpeeled and scrubbed
8 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted
1 1/2 teaspoons table salt 
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 
2 	tablespoons prepared horseradish 
1/4 cup grated fresh horseradish 
3 	medium scallions , green parts only, minced
1 	cup half-and-half , warm
	
1. Place potatoes in large saucepan with water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are just tender (paring knife can be slipped into and out of potato with very little resistance), 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.

2. Set food mill or ricer over now-empty but still-warm saucepan. Spear potato with dinner fork, then peel off skin with paring knife; repeat with remaining potatoes. Working in batches, cut peeled potatoes into rough chunks and drop into hopper of food mill or ricer. Process or rice potatoes into saucepan or mash potatoes with potato masher directly in saucepan.

3. Stir butter into potatoes until just incorporated. Sprinkle salt and pepper over potatoes. Whisk horseradish and scallions into warm half-and-half; add mixture to potatoes and stir until just combined. Serve immediately.
