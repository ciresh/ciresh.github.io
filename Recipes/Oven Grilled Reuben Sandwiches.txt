Oven Grilled Reuben Sandwiches

The store-bought sauerkraut often used in this classic deli sandwich can be bland and less than palatable. Our surprising solution is to simmer bagged coleslaw with vinegar and sugar to produce a great-tasting sauerkraut.

Serves 4

Sweet-and-sour cabbage and a zesty mustard-flavored mayonnaise transform this deli classic into something special. "Oven-grilling" allows you to cook the sandwiches all at once (and without turning them) rather than cooking in batches on the stovetop.

    * 1/3 cup cider vinegar
    * 2 tablespoons sugar
    * 1 (16-ounce) bag coleslaw mix
    * Table salt and ground black pepper
    * 1/4 cup mayonnaise
    * 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
    * 8 slices hearty rye bread
    * 8 slices Swiss cheese (about 1/2 pound)
    * 1 pound thinly sliced corned beef
    * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

   1. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Bring vinegar and sugar to boil in large skillet over medium heat. Stir to dissolve sugar, add coleslaw, cover, and cook, tossing occasionally, until coleslaw is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove lid and simmer until liquid has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
   2. Combine mayonnaise and mustard in small bowl. Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise mixture on each bread slice. Layer 1 slice cheese, 1/2 cup coleslaw, 1/4 pound corned beef, and 1 more slice cheese on top of 1 bread slice. Top with second slice of bread and compress sandwich with your hands. Repeat to make 3 more sandwiches. Brush tops and bottoms of sandwiches with melted butter.
   3. Transfer sandwiches to preheated baking sheet. Bake until toasted, about 10 minutes. Serve.
