Post Mortem

The Sous Vide frozen turkey breast from Stop&Shop was tough. It was cooked to 145, maybe in bath for 3 1/2 hours

Used a total of 4 cups broth to make gravy, it was a good thickness

The Turkey, 19 lbs took maybe 4:30-5 hours to cook.

Make ahead potatoes where a pain to make, had a weird texture, but tasted good and were well received.
